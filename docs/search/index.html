                    "content": "R Extensions SupportThe GraalVM R engine can run R extensions in two modes:  native: the native machine code is run directly on your CPU, this is the same as how GNU-R runs R extensions.  llvm: if the LLVM bitcode is available, it can be interpreted by GraalVM LLVM.The native mode is better suited for code that does not extensively interact with the R API, for example,plain C or Fortran numerical computations working on primitive arrays. The llvm mode provides significantlybetter performance for extensions that frequently call between R and the C/C++ code, because GraalVM LLVMengine is also partially evaluated by the Truffle compiler like the R code, both can be inlined and optimizedas one compilation unit. Moreover, GraalVM LLVM is supported byGraalVM tools which allows to, for instance,debug R and C code together.In one GraalVM R process, any R package can be loaded in either mode. That is, GraalVM R supportsmixing packages loaded in the native mode with packages loaded in the llvm mode in one process.Generating LLVM BitcodeAs of version 19.3.0, the GraalVM R engine is configured to use theLLVM toolchainto compile R packages native code. This toolchain produces standard executable binaries fora given system, but it also embeds the corresponding LLVM bitcode into them.The binaries produced by the LLVM Toolchain can be loaded in both modes: native or llvm.The GraalVM R engine can be reconfigured to use your system default compilerswhen installing R packages by running# use local installation of GGC:$ R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;)&#39;# to revert back to using the GraalVM&#39;s LLVM toolchain:$ R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;llvm&quot;)&#39;Using the system default compilers may be more reliable, but you loose theability to load the R packages built with the LLVM toolchain in the llvm mode,because they will not contain the embedded bitcode. Moreover, mixing packagesbuilt by the local system default compilers and packages built by the LLVMtoolchain in one GraalVM R process may cause linking issues.Fortran compilerAs of version 20.1.0, the GraalVM R engine uses gfortran as the default Fortrancompiler when installing R packages. Since gfortran cannot produce bitcode,packages that contain Fortran code will not work in the LLVM mode.The GraalVM R engine distribution contains tool F2C, which can convert Fortran code to Cand then compile it with the Labs LLVM Toolchain. One can configure The GraalVM R engineto use this tool by editing configuration file R_HOME/etc/Makeconf, variable FC.Choosing the Running ModeStarting from the version 19.3.0, the GraalVM R engine uses the following defaults:  native mode to load the packages  llvm toolchain to build their sourcesTo enable the llvm mode for loading the packages, use --R.BackEnd=llvm.You can also enable each mode selectively for given R packages by using:  --R.BackEndLLVM=package1,package2  --R.BackEndNative=package1,package2Moreover, you can configure which packages will be always run in the native modein file R_HOME/etc/native-packages. FastR comes with a default configuration thatcovers some popular R packages that are known to not work yet in the LLVM mode.",

                    "content": "19.0.2(2019-06-13)This is a bug fix release for 19.0 and we recommend upgrading for all 19.0.x users.Java  Improved compilation performance of scheduler phase.  Support retrieving annotations from class initializers (see 1320).  Fixed problems related to the freetype library: 1269, 1270, 1305.  Fixed Version string reporting (it was missing 64-Bit in the string).Native image  Fixed IllegalArgumentException: Cannot create Method for class initializer (see 1320).  Fixed an issue when the build would loop forever if META-INF/native-image/native-image.properties contains --force-fallback.  Fixed the issue where fallback image generation would not respect the --no-server argument.  Fix native-image-agent=restrict configuration detection.  Added -agentlib:native-image-agent=build configuration option.LLVM interpreterAllow LLVM interpreter Context to run without allowIO(true).19.0.0(2019-05-09)Early Adopter Windows SupportThe early adopter builds for Windows are available for GraalVM. These includethe JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, the Native Image capabilities,GraalVM’s JavaScript engine and the developer tools: Chrome inspector baseddebugger, Profiler etc.. Currently there is no gu utility or the ability toadd support for the other GraalVM languages.Java  We updated the base JDK to 8u212. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.Native ImageNative Image was extracted from the base GraalVM distribution. Currently it isavailable as an early adopter plugin. To install it, run: gu installnative-image. After this additional step, the native-image executable will bein the bin directory, as for the previous releases.There was a change in how classes are initialized in a native-image. Now, we initialize application classes at run time by default. The policy for initialization is as follows:  All JDK classes are initialized at build time.  We prove the safety of application static initializers after the analysis and initialize the safe classes.  We provide the following flags to control class initialization in a fine-grained way: --initialize-at-build-time and --initialize-at-run-time.The performance and startup impact of this change is negligible on all benchmarks that we have.This change was made to improve user experience: there is no need to writesubstitutions and to deal with instances of unsupported classes ending up in theimage heap. Their applications, given the right configuration for reflection,proxies, etc., should work without performance degradation.To allow framework authors and end users to keep the startup time at minimum weimproved functionality of --initialize-at-build-time and--initialize-at-run-time. These flags allow to specify a policy for wholepackages or individual classes. For example, if we have classes p.C1, p.C2,… , p.Cn, we can eagerly initialize this package with--initalize-at-build-time=p. If we want to delay one of the classes in packagep we can simply add --initialize-at-run-time=p.C1.The whole class hierarchy can be initialized at build time by simply passing --initalize-at-build-time on the command line.We also introduced the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization which allows you to track what class initialization does during the image build. This flag will help you configure the build to work as intended.What should I do if I am a library author?  To get your tests back in check you can use --intialize-at-build-time which will revert to the previous behaviour.  Then use the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization to see when classes get initialized. Based on this output you can make the proper configuration.  Configure your native-image.properties by passing --intialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;csv-of-classes-or-packages&amp;gt; to it.  Submit a pull request to the downstream libraries with the configuration you believe works well. That way your native-image.properties will be concerned only with the classes from your framework.  There is a known issue with lambdas being initialized at build time. If your lambda inherits an interface with a default method and static fields, those fields will get pulled into the image. We will provide a fix to this bug in the next two weeks.JavaScript  Fixed various bugs that address compilation problems.R  Fixed a fatal error on Linux platforms when sending SIGINT during long computations.  Fixed issues with the installation to protected locations: the default Renviron file sets the R_LIBS_USER to a directory inside the current user’s home. Users still have to create this directory manually. Alternatively, the configure_fastr script creates the directory, but for the current user only.  Implemented missing C API: S_realloc.Ruby  Various bug fixes. Most notably fixes around OpenSSL C extension compilation.  Renamed methods in the TruffleRuby object.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)  Fixed the issue with the ASTs and call trees not showing up.",

We recommend upgradingto it from the 19.1.x and older releases.This CPU release includes fixes for the following CVEs:  CVE-2019-2813  CVE-2019-2862For more information please see the Oracle July 2019 Security Advisory.Critical fixes to GraalVM Native Image listed below went also into this version:      Fixed Reflection.getCallerClass methods sometimes failing to acquire the correct frame in the native images (#1479).        Fixed an issue that could cause header files not being generated in the working directory when compiling shared libraries ahead-of-time.  19.1.0(2019-07-02)This is a feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.0.x releases.Java  Improved speed of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in GraalVM, which significantlyimproves the performance on medium length workloads.  Applied profile-guided optimization (PGO) when building the ahead-of-time (AOT) image of the compiler. This enables more aggressive optimization of the compiler itself providing better compilation throughput.Native imageWe fixed many issues that were reported on GitHub. You can browse the full list here.JavaScript  Added an experimental option js.locale to set the default locale for locale-sensitive operations.  Allow making evaluated sources internal using the sourceURL directive by prefixing the URL with internal:, e.g., //# sourceURL=internal:myname.js.  Improved code sharing across threads. Prior to this one context had to be closed before the code in it could be reused in another context , now for JavaScript contexts one can share code using ContextPolicy.SHARED without closing the context.In the following example the source code is shared between context1 and context2:public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.create()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (              Context context1 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build();              Context context2 = Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build()) {                context1.eval(source).asInt();                context2.eval(source).asInt();            }        }    }LLVM interpreter  Calling exit(...) in an embedded context is now a catchable PolyglotException.  Skip source path entries that we are not allowed to access. Previously, whenrunning in an embedded context with restricted access to the file system, theLLVM engine threw an exception when it could not read the source files, even ifno debugger was attached. Now it will still run. Only when a debugger isattached, an error is reported when the source file can’t be accessed.RubyThe GraalVM Ruby implementation in this version targets performance and compatibility improvements, new features implementations and multiple bug fixes. The most notable include:  Interactive sources (like the GraalVM polyglot shell) now all share the same binding (#1695).  Hash code calculation has been improved to reduce hash collisions for Hash and other cases.  eval(code, binding) for a fixed code containing blocks is now much faster. This improves the performance of rendering ERB templates containing loops.  rb_str_cat is faster due to the C string now being concatenated without first being converted to a Ruby string or having its encoding checked.A complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.R  Strings -Inf, +NaN, and -NaN are correctly parsed to doubles including ignoring leading and trailing whitespaces.  For loop creates and initializes the control variable even if there are no iterations (#77).  Updated the output of the capabilities builtin (#78).  is.function returns true for foreign executables.The complete project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library files from 3.7.0 to 3.7.3.  Improved performance of exceptions that do not escape.  Fixed caching of core sources in a native image with a preinitialized contextfor pre-built images and libpolyglot fast startup.  Implemented support for pwd.getpwuid, os.exec, os.execv, and os.execl modules.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.",

The updateis to address security vulnerabilities announced in the October 2019 Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory. The 19.2.1 version is a full distribution and and it is recommended to upgrade to it from older GraalVM versions.Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition 19.2.1 includes all the Java security fixes released as part of that CPU and mentioned in the Java SE 8 Release notes.  It also includes the following:  Update GraalVM Enterprise base Java to the 8u231 Oracle JDK version  Update GraalVM Community base Java to the 8u232 OpenJDK version  Update Node.js to 10.16.3Listed below are critical fixes that also went into this version:  Fixed a problem that prevented creating a native image including the GraalVM JavaScript engine combined with java.lang.CharSequence implementations that have non-trivial implementations of the length and charAt methods (see #1625).  Fixed a problem that could allow an exception to propagate past a catch clause that should handle it.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers can use GraalVM Enterprise environment in their cloud instances by simply installing it with yum. For more details, please seeGraalVM on OCI. Note: We currently do not recommend macOS users to upgrade to Catalina – a next majorrelease of macOS desktop operating system. We can not guarantee completecompatibility with GraalVM 19.2.1 or older versions yet.19.2.0.1(2019-09-13)We prepared a high severity update for GraalVM to address the following issues:  Fixed a critical compiler bug that caused String.indexOf to be executed incorrectly on older machines that do not support the TZCNT instruction. The problem causes incorrect string operations and typically shows up as truncated string values.  Fixed a bug causing the bounds check in Native Image’s implementation of System.arraycopy to overflow with large indices which typically causes process termination.  Fixed a bounds check for System.arraycopy in cases where the array is “virtualized” (i.e., can be in registers and stack slots instead of on the heap).  Removed declaration of otherwise unused SIOCGSTAMP symbol in Native Image. This allows use of Native Image on any Linux distro using a 5.2.x kernel such as the latest versions of Fedora, Ubuntu (except LTS release users), Arch, openSUSE (tumbleweed).19.2.0(2019-08-20)This is a GraalVM feature release, we recommend upgrading to it from the 19.1.x or older releases.Native ImageWe simplified the process of collecting data for profile-guided optimizations (PGO) for GraalVM Enterprise native images. PGO allows to optimize performance of native images by analyzing collected profiles during the image generation process. Since 19.2.0 you can collect data for PGO while running your application in a just-in-time (JIT) compiled mode:$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/java -Dgraal.PGOInstrument=myclass.iprof MyClass$ /graal-ee-19.2.0/bin/native-image --pgo=myclass.iprof MyClass$ ./myclassPerformanceWe improved throughput for native image in GraalVM Enterprise when no profiles are available. Running the Micronaut GraalVM example shows spending ~10% less CPU time and achieving a ~10% higher throughput of requests per CPU second in 19.2.We also solved a common usability problem when a class marked forinitialization at runtime gets inadvertently initialized at build time. The flag -H:+TraceClassInitialization was introduced to help tracing what classes got initialized at runtime.JavaScript  We added support for date, time, timezone, instant and duration interoperabilitytypes to distinguish date-like objects from multiplelanguages in polyglot contexts (see changes to GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs).  Added Context.Builder.timeZone to set the time zone.  We implemented the Numeric separators TC39 proposal. It isavailable in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  We moved ICU data for internationalization APIs, e.g., date and time formatting, number formatting, collation for each individual supported language, previously distributed as separate files in &amp;lt;GRAALVM_HOME&amp;gt;/jre/languages/js/icu4j/icudt to the executable of JavaScript (js).More changes are listed in the JavaScript component changelog.LLVM InterpreterWe added preliminary support for compiling native programs to bitcode usingthe LLVM toolchain. The LLVM toolchain is a set of tools and APIs for compilingnative projects, such as C and C++, to bitcode that can be executed with theGraalVM LLVM runtime. It is aimed to simplify ahead-of-time compilation forusers and language implementers who want to use the GraalVM LLVM runtime. To doso, we provide launchers that invoke the C/C++ compiler with special flags toproduce results that can be executed by the GraalVM LLVM runtime. For moredetails, please consult the LLVM reference documentation.The toolchain is an experimental feature in this release.A complete list of changes to GraalVM LLVM runtime can be found in thechangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to Ruby language component is available on GitHub. Major changes include:  Implemented support for Fiddle – an extension to translate a foreign function interface (FFI) and libffi wrapper for Ruby.  In terms of compatibility, Thread.report_on_exception is now true by defaultlike MRI 2.5+; BigDecimal compatibility has been generally improved in severalways.  Improved the performance by optimizing String methods to use the vectorinstructions when searching for a single-byte character in a String.  Fixed several bugs reported by community:          Set RbConfig::CONFIG[&#39;ruby_version&#39;] to the same value as the TruffleRuby version. This fixes reusing C extensions between different versions of TruffleRuby with Bundler (#1715).      Improved errors when interacting with single-threaded languages (#1709).      R  Added a new fastRCluster package that allows to run FastR inside GNU-R:          install in GNU-R or RStudio with: devtools::install_github(&#39;oracle/fastr/com.oracle.truffle.r.pkgs/fastRCluster&#39;);      use ?fastRCluster to learn more.        The problem that SET_ATTRIB does not validate the attributes as expected was resolved.The changelog is available on GitHub.PythonThe GraalVM Python implementation is still experimental and we are working towards improving completeness.  Implemented PyStructSequence_* C API – standard structured prediction functions.  Added support for more C API functions as PyEval_InitThreads and PyEval_ThreadsInitialized, type attributes i.e. nb_remainder, nb_subtract, overflowed and recursion_depth thread state fields.  Fixed printing of errors in the REPL and full paths in tracebacks.More details are available in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)We implemented the ability to configure custom polyglot access configuration withPolyglotAccess.newBuilder(). It allows to configure fine-grained accesscontrol for polyglot bindings and between polyglot languages. For example, givena TruffleObject as a value, there is a need to determine language and type ofthat object. This feature is significant for GraalVM execution inside OracleRDBMS.GraalVM 19.2.0 release also added support for date, time, timezone, durationvalues in polyglot APIs, and introduced the Context.Builder.timeZone(ZoneId)class to configure the default timezone of polyglot contexts.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle APIs changes between the versions are summarized in:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsA preview version of Java Flight Recorder (JFR) support has been released as a plugin for the VisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.0. The plugin reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 and newer and presents the data in typical VisualVM views familiar for its users.To install the JFR support, download GraalVM 19.2.0 from graalvm.org/downloads, unzip it and run /bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM.Use `Tools | Plugins | Available Plugins` to list all available plugins and install the VisualVM-JFR and VisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File | Load… action or by double-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFR repository permanently.Please follow the documentation of your Java installation how to create JFR snapshots.JFR support is currently anexperimentalfeature. Some advanced features like analyzing JVM internals, showing eventstack traces or support for creating JFR snapshots from live processes are notavailable in the preview version and will be addressed incrementally in thefollowing releases.GraalVM Updater UtilityWe fixed an issue where GraalVM Enterprise would by default download the GraalVM Community components from GitHub. If you are using GraalVM Community – nothing changes, you can still install the components as before, and the gu will locate the necessary jar files on GitHub and correctly install them:gu install native-image ruby R pythonIf you are using GraalVM Enterprise, you can install R and llvm-toolchain components from GitHub, for example:gu install RThe other components are available from the OTN page, and can be installed from a manually downloaded file, for example to install native-image support run:gu -L install native-image-installable-svm-svmee-darwin-amd64-19.2.0.jarVersion CalendarYou can now refer to GraalVM version calendar to learn more about the GraalVM release model and prepare for upcoming releases.",

This issue inthe GraalVM build process will be remedied in future releases.Listed below are issues addressed in this release:  Resolved the issue of NullPointerException being thrown with SecurityServicesFeature when the application uses non-JDK related services (#1893).  Made efforts to turn Code coverage command line tool more reliable (#1800).  Prevented linking errors in Unsafe and ClassLoader by substituting all native methods (#1920).  Made dynamically generate On_Load_* function call for static libraries so all libraries are known before the image generation to prevent -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true returning an incorrect value (#1937).  Fixed ProcessHandle properties not providing useful values when running a native image (#2001).  Fixed an unsynchronized java.util.WeakHashMap.get access when single engine isshared between several thread local polyglot contexts (#1916).  Fixed an issue of JDK 11  GraalVM build not being recognized by macOS /usr/libexec/java_home -V (#801).  Implemented a new C APIs used by JSON 2.3.0 (#1857).  Ensured that GraalVM Native Image does  not have references to native methods from java.lang.reflect.Proxy (#1971).  Ensured that all native methods of core classes would be substituted to prevent reflection configuration issues (#1848).  Fixed an issue leading to JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (#1867).  Ensured that DynamicProxySupport classes being called from multiple threads are thread safe (#1927).  Prevent static field values changing during a native image generation (#1945).  Fixed the issue with the native linking step at image writing phase when the image uses functions from unsupported static JDK libraries (#1875).19.3.0.2(2019-12-24)This is a bugfix update including fixes to the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI) and necessary updates to the JDK 11 support.The following issues were addressed:  Approached the issue of DynamicProxySupport being not thread safe when DynamicProxySupport.addProxyClass is called from multiple threads (see #1927).  Resolved a problem leading to a wrong execution of the code produced with the GraalVM native-image builder at optimization level 2 -H:Optimize=2 (see #1995).  Fixed a problem when JavaFX applications misbehave with GraalArithmeticStubs (see #1867).  Resolved an issue of VM crashing when run with Serial GC (see #1892).  ReduceInitialCardMarks is unsafe with OptBulkAllocation in JDK 11 (see #1915).  Fixed a transient crash while building native images with GraalVM based on JDK11 (see #1906).19.3.0(2019-11-19)GraalVM 19.3 is the first planned Medium-Term Support (MTS) release built fromthe main line of the project. This is also a major feature release and it is arecommended upgrade to it. The MTS status assures that stability, security, andperformance fixes will be backported from the current branch for the next 18months.GraalVM JDK 11 Based BuildsWith the major update to the 19.3 version, we announce the first release ofGraalVM based on JDK 11! This represents a substantial milestone given thedifferences between JDK 8 and JDK 11. In particular, the Java Platform ModuleSystem (JPMS) introduced in JDK 9 means GraalVM now uses module encapsulation to isolate code such as JVMCI, the GraalVM compiler and the Truffle API from application code. In addition, it means GraalVM on JDK 11 includes all theJDK changes since JDK 8. These are detailed in the release notes for JDK 9,JDK 10and JDK 11.In terms of languages, GraalVM on JDK11 supports all JVM languages (Java, Scala etc.) aswell as all guest languages currently supported in GraalVM on JDK8.Due to the modular structure of the base JDK, there is no more $GRAALVM_HOME/jre/ directoryin the GraalVM package based on JDK 11. This has an impact on the path to the languages location,e.g., $GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/js now becomes $GRAALVM_HOME/languages/js):GraalVM Native Imageon JDK 11 allows usage of all JDK 8 command line options. Currently the nativeimage builder ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image) does not support the JavaPlatform Module System (JPMS) and has no module introspection at image run time.Pease note, at present GraalVM Updater cannot rebuild images ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images) with GraalVM Enterprise and Community editions on JDK 11. Even if GraalVM Native Image is installed, a user will encounter the following error while rebuilding:$ $GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu rebuild-images rubyError: rebuild-images utility is not available. You may need to install &quot;native-image&quot; component.Please refer to documentation for the details.A possible workaround is to rebuild images invoking rebuild-images command directly, e.g.:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/rebuild-images rubyPlease be informed, to have GraalVM JDK 11 based build on macOS listed by /usr/libexec/java_home -V you need to:  extract the GraalVM archive to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/ location  mkdir /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  cd /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java11-19.3.0/Contents/MacOS  ln -s ../Home/lib/jli/libjli.dylibThis issue will be fixed in the next release.GraalVM JDK 11 on ARM64We provide a preview of GraalVM Community Edition on JDK 11 for ARM64architecture. It includes the support for all JVM languages. The support for theother languages should follow soon after. This distribution includes GraalVMNative Image off the shelf to build instantly starting applications whichconsume less memory in ARM64 environments.There are some known limitations with this distribution at the moment:  npm and node do not support runtime code installation (Trufflecompilations). To avoid failing with java.lang.NullPointerException, disableTruffle compilations with npm --vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false or node--vm.Dgraal.TruffleCompilation=false.  npm and node crash with  a free(): invalid pointer error.Native ImageGraalVM 19.3 switched to using the JDK native code instead of manualsubstitutions. For GraalVM Native Image this switch to Java Native Interface(JNI) platform enabled the possibility to provide support for JDK 11 andextended support for Windows OS. It has no impact on startup time or memoryfootprint, and eliminates the need for shipping JDK libraries such aslibsunec.so along with native images that use Java crypto services. GraalVMnow ships with statically linkable version of the JDK libraries.Note that the sunec native library of SunEC provider gets statically linkedinto an image if required (see#951). Thus native images do notdepend on the sunec shared library anymore at runtime. However, if SunECprovider gets statically linked into an image on Linux and macOS the image willdepend on libstdc++.Native Image Maven PluginSupport for using GraalVM Native Image with Maven was introduced with theNative Image Maven Plugin. It means auser can build a project and its native image directly with Maven using the mvnpackage command. As of the GraalVM version 19.3, the Maven &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt; for theGraalVM Native Image related artifacts, including the plugin, changed fromcom.oracle.substratevm to org.graalvm.nativeimage:&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.nativeimage&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;native-image-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;19.3.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;native-image&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;package&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;skip&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/skip&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;            --no-fallback        &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;To use the plugin make sure GraalVM home is set as your JAVA_HOME environment and Native Image is installed. Using the plugin without GraalVM is not recommend.GraalVM Compiler  We have improved System.arraycopy to eliminate store checks when copying toObject[]. That improvement fixes slowdowns (versus C2) on some EclipseCollections benchmarks.  A performance regression when creating List values in Scala has been fixed bymore optimized inlining.  Fixed an issue that could prevent a method from being compiled that contains the JSR bytecode produced by older javac versions (see #1699).JavaScriptThe Node.js runtime available with GraalVM was updated to the 12.10.0 version, which brought some breaking changes.Additional proposals for ECMAScript 2020 have been implemented (Promise.allSettled and Nullish coalescing) and are available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).To provide better compatibility with the ECMAScript specification, some extensions are now disabled by default, some depending on the launcher (js, node, or via GraalVM Polyglot Context). This includes the print and printErr functions (the js.print flag), the global built-in (superseded by globalThis, use the js.global-property flag to reenable), or the performance global property (the js.performance flag).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM InterpreterIn GraalVM 19.3 clang and other LLVM tools are no longer required to beinstalled for building the GraalVM LLVM runtime. The LLVM toolchain bundled with GraalVM is used.Also the LLVM toolchain is not an “experimental” feature any more and is used by other languages.For example, save this native code demonstrating the interoperability with Java as a polyglot.c file:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *arrayType = polyglot_java_type(&quot;int[]&quot;);    void *array = polyglot_new_instance(arrayType, 4);    polyglot_set_array_element(array, 2, 42);    int element = polyglot_as_i32(polyglot_get_array_element(array, 2));    printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, element);    return element;}Now you can compile it using GraalVM drop-in replacement of traditional clang:$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/llvm/native/bin/clang polyglot.c -o polyglotThen run the executable (polyglot) with its dependencies encoded in GraalVM LLVM runtime:lli polyglotList of features that have also been added:  Preliminary support for parsing bitcode produced by LLVM 9  Added intrinsics for pthread thread management functions  Support for pthreads LLVM bitcodeRefer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Updated Python standard library to 3.7.4.  Implemented support for NumPy 1.16.4 and Pandas 0.25.0, that can be installed with:$ graalpython -m ginstall install numpy$ graalpython -m ginstall install pandas  With the help of Weblogic Scripting Team in conversion of Jython into GraalVM Python,added Jython compatibility (enabled with --python.EmulateJython) that allows importing ofJava classes and catching of Java exceptions in Python the same way Jython allows it.$ graalpython --jvm --experimental-option --python.EmulateJython&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import sun.misc.Signal&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.lang import Integer, NumberFormatException&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try:...   Integer.parseInt(&quot;99&quot;, 8)... except NumberFormatException as e:...   pass  Added support for basic sockets. Note that SSL is not implemented, thus there is no https yet:import urllib.requestprint(urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;http://google.com&quot;).read())  Implemented missing functions and fixed bugs to run various modules (timeit, socket, pytest).  Improved performance of Java interoperability, exceptions that do not escape,various C API functions, and the parser. The parser is ~20% faster now, sometimes upto ~40%, the performance in micro benchmarks is 5x faster, micro benchmarks forC API are 5x faster, but there is no change to NumPy performance numbers.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  FastR has been updated to R version 3.6.1.  In this release, FastR does not ship with GCC runtime libraries. Use the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:          Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.04: apt-get install libgfortran3 libgomp1      Oracle Linux 7: yum install libgfortran libgomp      Oracle Linux 8: yum install compat-libgfortran-48      MacOS: brew install gcc@4.9        Preview of support for LLVM based execution of R native extensions.          FastR is configured to use the GraalVM LLVM toolchain to compile the C/C++ and Fortran code of R packages. The resulting binarieswill contain both the native code and the LLVM bitcode. The R packages that are shipped with FastR were also compiledusing the GraalVM LLVM toolchain and their binaries contain the LLVM bitcode.      FastR loads and runs the R extensions native code by default, but when run with the option --R.BackEnd=llvm,it will load and run the LLVM bitcode if available. You can use the LLVM backend selectively for specific R packages via --R.BackEndLLVM=pkg1,pkg2.      If you encounter any issues when installing R packages, you can switch back from the GraalVM LLVM toolchainto the native toolchain by running fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;) or by manually editing the $FASTR_HOME/etc/Makeconf file.        Fixed memory leaks reported on GitHub.  Fixed failures when working with large vectors (&amp;gt;1GB).  Implemented grepRaw, but only for fixed=T.We encourage the users to experiment with the new LLVM support and report anyissues to GitHub. To see thecomplete list of changes, please refer to the projectchangelog.RubyA comprehensive list of changes to the Ruby language component is available on GitHub.The focus has been on improving compatibility with Ruby on Rails applications.Major changes include:  Compilation of C extensions is now done with an internal LLVM toolchain producing both native code and bitcode. This means more C extensions should compile out of the box and this should resolve most linker-related issues.  It is no longer necessary to install LLVM for installing C extensions on TruffleRuby.  It is no longer necessary to install libc++ and libc++abi for installing C++ extensions on TruffleRuby.  On macOS, it is no longer necessary to install the system headers package (#1417).  License updated to EPL 2.0/GPL 2.0/LGPL 2.1 like recent JRuby.  Installing sassc now works due to using the LLVM toolchain (#1753).  Include executables of default gems, needed for rails new in Rails 6.ToolsCode Coverage Command Line ToolAs of version 19.3 GraalVM provides a code coverage command line tool to recordand analyze the source code coverage of a particular execution of code forlanguages implemented with the Truffle framework. Enable it with --codecoverageoption, for example js --codecoverage. Visit the tool reference documentation for moreinformation.GraalVM VisualVM  Previously, to view the JFR files you had to install a plugin. Now GraalVM VisualVM contains the viewer in the tool core. Other JFR viewer improvements include new views for Exceptions and GC, improved performance and accuracy.  The tool is now able to monitor and profile AArch64 Java and Java 13 processes.Debugger  Enabled support for functional breakpoints and memory tools in Chrome Inspector.Visual Studio Code ExtensionsVSCode extensions are provided as VSIX packages. GraalVM team created the firstVSIX extension based on Python implementation. The extension installs with npmpackage manager and upon the extension installation, the user is requested topoint the PATH environment variable to GraalVM home directory.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  Added new APIs for statement count resource limits:ResourceLimits.newBuilder()ResourceLimits.newBuilder()    .statementLimit(1000, null)    .build();              Duration.ofMillis(10))    .statementLimit(1000, null).build();try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                .resourceLimits(limits).build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;while(true);&quot;);    assert false;} catch (PolyglotException e) {    assert e.isCancelled();}  The default temporary directory can now be configured by FileSystem. A getTempDirectory()method of the FileSystem interface will return the default temporary directory.  Added the org.graalvm.home.Version version utility that allows to create, validate and compare GraalVM versions.  Added support for detecting and mapping polyglot exception values. Exceptions can be detected using Value.isException().  Added default target type mapping from guest language exceptions to PolyglotException.Proceed to the GraalVM SDK changelog for the complete list of changes.Changes for GraalVM Language or Tool Implementers (Truffle)  Added standard block node for language implementations. The block node usage allows the optimizingruntime to group elements of a block into multiple block compilation units. This optimization may beenabled using --engine.PartialBlockCompilation (on by default) and configuredusing --engine.PartialBlockCompilationSize (default 3000).  Merged new experimental inlining heuristic. Inlining budgets are now based on Graal IR nodecounts and no longer Truffle Node counts.  Support boolean literals in Truffle DSL expressions. Use true or false in expressions,e.g., isFunction(value) == false.  Added support for temporary files and directories.  Threads created by the embedder may now be collected by the GC before they canbe disposed. If languages hold onto thread objects exposed viainitializeThread they now need to do so with WeakReference. This avoidsleaking thread instances.  Added the new execute method to LoopNode, which allows loops to return values.To see the full list of changes to the APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

It is currently based on GNU-R 3.6.1, and moves to new majorversions of R as they become available and stable. The FastR project, maintains an extensive set of unittests for all aspects of the R language and the builtin functionality, and thesetests are available as part of the R source code. GraalVM R engine aims to befully compatible with GNU R, including its native interface as used by R extensions. Itcan install and run unmodified complex R packages like ggplot2, Shiny, orRcpp. As some packages rely on unspecified behavior or implementation detailsof GNU-R, support for packages is work in progress, and some packages might notinstall successfully or work as expected.Packages can be installed using the install.packages function or the R CMD INSTALL shell command.By default, R uses fixed snapshot of the CRAN repository1.This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting the repos argument of the install.packages function.This functionality does not interfere with the checkpoint package. If you are behind a proxy server, makesure to configure the proxy either with environment variables or using the JVM options,e.g., --vm.Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true.Versions of some packages specifically patched for GraalVM implementation of R can be installed using the install.fastr.packagesfunction that downloads them from the GitHub repository.Currently, those are rJava and data.table.Known limitations of GraalVM implementation of R compared to GNU R:  Only small parts of the low-level graphics package are functional. However, the grid package is supported and R can install and run packages based on it like ggplot2.   Support for the graphics package in R is planned for future releases.  Encoding of character vectors. Related builtins (e.g., Encoding) are available,   but do not execute any useful code. Character vectors are represented as Java Strings and therefore encoded in UTF-16 format. GraalVM implementation of R will add support for encoding in future releases.  Some parts of the native API (e.g., DATAPTR) expose implementation details that are hard to emulate for alternative implementations of R. These are implemented as needed while testing the GraalVM implementation of R with various CRAN packages.You can use the compatibility checker to find whether the CRAN packages you are interested in are tested on GraalVM and whether the tests pass successfully.1 More technically, GraalVM implementation of R uses a fixed MRAN URL from $R_HOME/etc/DEFAULT_CRAN_MIRROR, which is a snapshot of theCRAN repository as it was visible at a given date from the URL string.",

Windows is no longer an experimental platform in the GraalVM ecosystem.Windows builds now contain the functional gu utility to install thecomponents. GraalVM Native Image component needs to be installedwith gu as on other platforms. JavaScript engine is now included in the GraalVM Windows distribution. Node.js support on the Windows platform is scheduled to be included in the next GraalVM release (20.1).GraalWasm, the WebAssembly component, is distributed through the usual component distribution channels.The GraalVM distribution for AArch64 now includes a functional node.js runtime (both in --jvm and native modes).Java  GraalVM Community Editions are based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_242 and OpenJDK version 11.0.6.  GraalVM Enterprise Editions are based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_241 and Oracle JDK version 11.0.6. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added mitigation of Jump Conditional Code (JCC) Erratum (see #1829).  GraalVM has a default setting of ThreadPriorityPolicy=1, which means thread priorities set in Java are reflected by native operating sytstem thread priorities. This may affect Java application performance.Native Image  Native Image support on Windows has significantly advanced. Please report issues if you find any problems.  Native images built with GraalVM Enterprise can now include a G1-based low latency garbage collector that reduces stop-the-world pauses and improves latency. It is an experimental feature that can be enabled at image build time with -H:+UseLowLatencyGC. For more details, please refer to the documentation.  Fixed several Java Native Interface (JNI) and JDK11 related issues, please refer to GitHub for more information.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 12.15.0, please see Node.js 12.15.0 release notes.  Added the js.commonjs-require option to load npm-compatible CommonJS modules from plain JavaScript. This is an experimental feature. See NodeJSVSJavaScriptContext.md for details.  Added the js.load-from-classpath option to allow loading files from the classpath via the classpath: pseudo URLs (disabled by default). Its usage is not recommended with untrusted code.  Added the implementation of the String.prototype.replaceAll proposal. It is available in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Updated String.prototype.matchAll to be available only in ECMAScript 2020 mode (--js.ecmascript-version=2020).  Added the js.bind-member-functions option for the implicit binding of unbound functions returned by Value.getMember to the receiver. The preferred way of calling members is using Value.invokeMember.  Made the support for Nashorn pseudo URLs available only in the Nashorn compatibility mode (--js.nashorn-compat).  Implemented support for public and private class fields, including static fields. This feature can be enabled using the experimental option js.class-fields and is available by default in Node.js.  Added the js.global-arguments option with true as a default value for the non-standard arguments global property.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  The toolchain is now based on LLVM 9.0.0.  Support accessing llvm-ar, llvm-nm, llvm-objcopy, llvm-objdump, llvm-ranlib, llvm-readelf, llvm-readobj and llvm-strip via the toolchain.For more details refer to the component changelog on GitHub.Python  Improved Jython Compatibility by implementing syntax from JavaType import * to import all static members of a Java class, and by enabling import of Python code from inside JAR files by adding path/to/jarfile.jar!path/inside/jar to sys.path.  Added support for date and time interop.  Added support for setting the time zone via Context.Builder.timeZone.  Implemented PEP 570 - Python Positional-Only Parameters.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  On Linux, the required version of libgfortran changed from 3 to 5. See the requirements section for details.  Implemented subsetting an array by numeric and/or string matrix.  Fixed an issue where polyglot value is not an object (see #123).  Fixed an issue with the incorrect formatting for sprintf %g and %G (trailing zeroes, see #126).  Added  R builtins and C APIs:          Ported all external C functions used by nlm (see #100) and fisher.test from the stats base package.      Added Rf_asS4 C API function (see #118).      More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyA detailed changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub.  Updated to Ruby 2.6.5 (see #1749).  Updated the internal LLVM toolchain to LLVM 9 and reduce its download size.  Automatically set PKG_CONFIG_PATH as needed for compiling OpenSSL on macOS (see #1830).  Performance improvements related to sockets and RSTRING_PTR.  100+ compatibility and bug fixes, please refer to the changelog.Changes for GraalVM Embedders (SDK)  The deprecated graalvm.home and graalvm.version system properties have been removed, use the HomeFinder instead.  Added EventContext.createError which allows to introduce guest application errors in execution listeners/nodes.  Added Context.Builder.currentWorkingDirectory to set the current working directory used by the guest application to resolve relative paths.  The algorithm used to generate a unique URI for a Source built without an URI was changed to SHA-256.  All Truffle Graal runtime options (-Dgraal.) will be deprecated with 20.1. The Truffle runtime options are no longer specified as Graal options (-Dgraal.). The Graal options must be replaced by corresponding engine options specified using the polyglot API. The TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION environment variable can be used to detect usages of deprecated GraalVM options. When the TRUFFLE_STRICT_OPTION_DEPRECATION is set to true and the deprecated Graal option is used, the Truffle runtime throws an exception listing the used deprecated options and corresponding replacements.More details are in the SDK and Truffle changelogs.Tooling  Added an option for gu to install all available components from a local directory, for example: gu install -C /path/to/downloaded/20.0-components/ native-image llvm-toolchain ruby r python wasm.  Added a JDK Flight Recorder Data Viewer to VisualVM.  Added an integration of T-trace instrumentation framework with OpenTracing.  Added LLVM languages support to T-trace instrumentation framework  Added a Technology Preview of the Language Server Protocol implementation for GraalVM languages and its support to GraalVM VSCode Extensions.",

Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition is based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_251 andOracle JDK version 11.0.7. You can find Oracle JDK release notes for theseversions at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Added support for compiling classes with irreducible loops in the bytecode. Theseoften occur in Kotlin applications using coroutines with loops. The supportboth improves performance of such applications and enables their ahead-of-time compilation.  Added new TuneInlinerExploration option to increase or decrease the time spentexploring inlining opportunities. Tuning this option helps to achieve betterpeak performance or limit time to reach (potentially lower) peak performancewhich might improve overall speed of the program. This option is only aheuristic and should be tuned for a specific application. This is a GraalVM Enterprise feature.  Added support to optimize away some redundant clone operations. For example, incode patterns similar to the one below, the GraalVM compiler will avoid creatingthe array clone:new int[length].clone().length      Added support for visualizing libgraal memory usage in VisualVM:    The mitigation of the Intel JumpConditional Code (JCC) Erratum is now only enabled for CPUs that need it.  Significantly improved performance for some benchmarks on JDK 11 due to fixes inthe area of synchronization. The most notable improvement isRenaissance:reactorswhich shows approximately 50% better results.Native Image  Improved scalability of the static analysis. The static analysis time wasinfeasible for some large applications. We added a new mechanism, called“saturated type flows”, to make the analysis faster. The new analysis isdisabled by default for GraalVM 20.1, but we plan to enable it by default in afuture release. We encourage all users to try it out using the image builderoption -H:+RemoveSaturatedTypeFlows. According to our measurements theprecision of the static analysis is comparable, but if you have an applicationwhere many more classes or methods are reachable with this option please create an issue on GitHub.  Added new option for the image generator to exit handlers on terminationsignals: --install-exit-handlers. This improves the user experience whenrunning a native image in a Docker container as the init process, since Linuxdoes not install a default signal handler for the process with id “1” and thenative image is therefore not reacting to a shutdown request from Docker.  Improved support for soft references. Before 20.1, soft references (the JavaSoftReference class) were cleared immediately at every GC like weakreferences. Now they are cleared based on a policy that takes the last accessand the memory pressure into account.  Added survivor spaces to the GC. Disabled by default until a proper policy isimplemented, see this GitHub issue for ideas and tasks aroundGC in native images.  Added generation of Dwarf debug information.  Improved support for timezones: information about all timezones is now includedin every image, and the default timezone is correctly initialized at imagestartup and no longer fixed at image generation time.  Improved checking that the native compiler toolchain is correct, for example,whether the compiler version on Windows is correct. This avoids strange errors dueto known incompatible compiler versions.Many more compatibility improvements and bug fixes can be found on GitHub. Forexample, here is a list of fixed issues relevant for Spring framework support.JavaScript  Enabled ECMAScript 2020 mode features by default.  Implemented several ECMAScript proposals, including Optional Chaining, HashbangGrammar, FinalizationRegistry, private class methods, RegExp Match Indices,export * as ns from &quot;mod&quot;, Intl.Locale, Intl.DisplayNames, Intl.DateTimeFormatdateStyle and timeStyle.  Added npx (npm package runner) utility into GraalVM distributions.  Removed the JOni RegExp-engine and the use-tregex option. TRegex engine is now the default regex engine.  Removed our SIMD.js implementation.LLVM Runtime  Added a preliminary support for running C++ code in managed mode. This is a GraalVM Enterprise feature.  Updated musl libc to version 1.1.24. This is a GraalVM Enterprise feature.  Both libc++ and libc++abi are now shipped as bitcode libraries.  Improved C++ support, libsulong++ is loaded only if libc++ is loaded. Theexecutables (ELF, Mach-O) compiled with the toolchain usually have a dependencyon this library and will continue to work. Plain bitcode files, which do notallow specification of dependencies, may fail with an error similar to thefollowing:    Global variable ZNSt3_15ctypeIcE2idE is declared but not defined.    This can be solved, for example, by specifying the dependency on the commandline lli --lib libc++.so.1 ... on Linux or lli --lib libc++.1.dylib onmacOS.    Changed module initialization order to be only based on the dependenciesrecorded in the ELF/Mach-O file (instead of looking at imported symbols). Thismight change the order in which plain bitcode files are initialized since theydo not allow recording dependencies. If the initialization order is important,the suggested approach is to use ELF/Mach-O files. See theToolchaindocumentation for more details.  Added support for on-stack-replacement of loops during bitcode execution, now itcan compile long-running loops before the surrounding function is compiled.Python  Updated to Python 3.8.2.  Improved tuples with primitive elements performance.  Improved performance of sequences, sets, dicts, and list expressions.  Added support of cProfile and trace modules through the GraalVM CPU sampler and coverage, respectively.  Added support of NumPy on macOS.  Added support of setuptools-scm and pytz.timezone.  Added support of a new syntax for iterable unpacking from yield and return statements.  Fixed issues with inspection and printing of non-Python numbers in the Chrome debugger.  Fixed issues with AST sharing across different contexts when these contexts run concurrently on multiple threads.  Fixed passing non-ASCII strings to gethostbyname.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: treat Java null as identical to Python None when comparing with the is operator.  Improved Jython compatibility mode: isinstance now works with Java classes and objects.  Moved all GraalPython specific functions on sys or builtins to the _graalpython_ module.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.R  Preview of improved graphical support based on the graphics, grDevices, and JavaGD packages          Use --R.UseInternalGridGraphics=false to activate this feature.      Our custom grid package re-implementation, which is currently the default, will be first deprecated and then removed in future releases.        Included GCC runtime libraries for supported systems (Linux and macOS)  Removed GFortran as a requirement to run FastR.  The GFortran runtime libraries versions are 4.8.5 on Linux and 8.3.0 on macOS. When compiling additional R packages with Fortran code, one must use GFortran of the same or higher version.          There’s a known issue: the libgomp.1.dylib library is not distributed with FastR on MacOS. To workaround this issue: install GCC with the package manager of your choice, e.g., brew install gcclocate file libgomp.1.dylib. Variable $GOMPLIB will denote full path to this library and $R_HOMEthe path to R installation:$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/R on JDK8 based builds$GRAALVM_HOME/languages/R on JDK11 based buildsexecute these two commands:install_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRblas.dylibinstall_name_tool -change /cm/shared/apps/gcc/8.3.0/lib/libgomp.1.dylib $GOMPLIB $R_HOME/lib/libRlapack.dylib        GFortran is now the default Fortran compiler even in the LLVM toolchain configuration.  Added support for traceback() to show frames from other GraalVM languages and C/C++ when run in the LLVM mode (--R.BackEnd=llvm).  Improved interoperability with other languages: “@” and “$” can be used to access members of foreign polyglot objects.A detailed list of the changes and bug fixes is available in the project changelog.Ruby  Added nightly builds, see the README for details.  ||= will not compile the right-hand-side if it is only executed once, to match the idiomatic lazy-initialization use-case (see the blog post).  Optimized performance of bundle install.  Added the --metrics-profile-require option to profile searching, parsing, translating and loading files.  Changed the C API type VALUE to be defined as unsigned long as on MRI. This enables using switch (VALUE) and other expressions which rely on VALUE being an integer type.  Removed deprecated Truffle::System.full_memory_barrier, Truffle::Primitive.logical_processors, and Truffle::AtomicReference.  Improved interoperability with other languages: hash keys are no longer reported as polyglot members.  Added Truffle::Interop.hash_keys_as_members to treat a Ruby Hash as a polyglot object with the Hash keys as members.Other 56 bug fixes and 52 compatibility improvements, see a detailed changelog.ToolingChrome Inspector  Implemented the display of asynchronous stack traces in debugger, in Chrome Inspector and in exception traces.Language Server Protocol  Improved stability of GraalVM Language Server and GraalVM VSCode Extensions.  Changed to start GraalVM Language Server in the native mode for better startup performance.  Stabilized support for LSP in R and Ruby.VisualVM  Enabled VisualVM to monitor libgraal memory usage.  Implemented showing compiled and interpreter time in the GraalVM sampler.  Improved JFR viewer to display stack traces for JFR events.Ideal Graph Visualizer      Added grouping of graph dumps by session:    Added an action to go to compiler classes.  Improved stability of IGV to no longer hang on some graph layout.GraalVM Updater gu  Added support for wildcards when GraalVM Updater installs from a directory (-C).Updates for Polyglot Embedders  Added Value.isMetaObject(), Value.getMetaQualifiedName(), Value.getMetaSimpleName() and Value.isMetaInstance(Object) to allow language agnostic access to meta-objects like classes or types.  The result of Value.getMetaObject() will always return meta-objects. It is recommended but not required to change uses of meta-objects to use Value.getMetaQualifiedName() instead of Value.toString() to return a type name.  Added OptionDescriptor.getDeprecationMessage returning the option deprecation reason. Added OptionDescriptor.Builder.deprecationMessage() to set the option deprecation reason.  Added Context.Builder.hostClassLoader to allow an embedder to specify a context ClassLoader for code execution.More changes can be found in the GraalVM SDK changelog.Updates for Language and Tool Implementers  engine.Mode is now a supported option and no longer experimental.  Added new meta-data APIs to InteropLibrary:          has/getLanguage(Object receiver) to access the original language of an object      has/getSourceLocation(Object receiver) to access the source location of an object (e.g., a function or classes)      has/toDisplayString(Object receiver, boolean allowsSideEffect) to produce a human-readable string      has/getMetaObject(Object receiver) to access the meta-object of an object      isMetaObject(Object receiver) to find out whether an object is a meta-object (e.g., Java class)      getMetaQualifiedName(Object receiver) to get the qualified name of a meta-object      getMetaSimpleName(Object receiver) to get the simple name of a the meta-object      isMetaInstance(Object receiver, Object instance) to check whether an object is an instance of a meta-object        Added TruffleLanguage.getLanguageView that allows to wrap values to add language specific information for primitive and foreign values.  Added TruffleLanguage.getScopedView that allows to wrap values to add scoping and visibility to language values.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getScopedView and TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageView to access language and scoped views from instruments.  Added TruffleInstrument.Env.getLanguageInfo to convert language classes to LanguageInfo.  Added @GenerateLibrary(dynamicDispatchEnabled = false) that allows to disable dynamic dispatch semantics for a library. The default is true.  Added ability to load external default exports for libraries using a service provider. See GenerateLibrary(defaultExportLookupEnabled = true).  Added @ExportLibrary(transitionLimit=&quot;3&quot;) that allows the accepts condition of exported libraries to transition from true to false for a library created for a receiver instance. This is, for example, useful to export messages for array strategies.  Added support for asynchronous stack traces for languages and tools to allow debuggers to show them.To see a full list of changes to APIs, proceed to theGraalVM Truffle changelog.",

Note that you must start the R script with --polyglot to have access to other GraalVM languages.GraalVM execution of R provides the following interoperability primitives:  eval.polyglot(&#39;languageId&#39;, &#39;code&#39;) evaluates code in some other language, the languageId can be, e.g., js.  eval.polyglot(path = &#39;/path/to/file.extension&#39;) evaluates code loaded from a file. The language is recognized from the extension.  export(&#39;polyglot-value-name&#39;, rObject) exports an R object so that it can be imported by other languages.  import(&#39;exported-polyglot-value-name&#39;) imports a polyglot value exported by some other language.Please use the ?functionName syntax to learn more. The following example demonstrates the interoperability features:# get an array from Rubyx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;)print(x[[1]])# [1] 1# get a JavaScript objectx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(path=&#39;r_example.js&#39;)print(x$a)# [1] &quot;value&quot;# use R vector in JavaScriptexport(&#39;robj&#39;, c(1,2,3))eval.polyglot(&#39;js&#39;, paste0(    &#39;rvalue = Polyglot.import(&quot;robj&quot;); &#39;,    &#39;console.log(&quot;JavaScript: &quot; + rvalue.length);&#39;))# JavaScript: 3# NULL -- the return value of eval.polyglot(Uses r_example.js.)R vectors are presented as arrays to other languages. This includes single element vectors, e.g., 42L or NA.However, single element vectors that do not contain NA can be typically used in places where the otherlanguages expect a scalar value. Array subscript or similar operation can be used in other languages to accessindividual elements of an R vector. If the element of the vector is not NA, the actual valueis returned as a scalar value, e.g. int. If the element is NA, then a special object that looks like nullis returned. The following Ruby code demonstrates this.vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c(NA, 42)&quot;)p vec[0].nil?# truep vec[1]# 42vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)p vec.to_s# &quot;[42]&quot;p vec[0]# 42The foreign objects passed to R are implicitly treated as specific R types.The following table gives some examples.            Example of foreign object (Java)      Viewed ‘as if’ on the R side                  int[] {1,2,3}      c(1L,2L,3L)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }      matrix(c(1:3,1:3),nrow=3)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3} }      not supported: raises error              Object[] {1, ‘a’, ‘1’}      list(1L, ‘a’, ‘1’)              42      42L      In the following code example, we can simply just pass the Ruby array to the R built-in function sum,which will work with the Ruby array as if it was integer vector.sum(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))Foreign objects can be also explicitly wrapped into adapters that make them look like the desired R type.In such a case, no data copying occurs if possible. The code snippet below shows the most common use cases.# gives list instead of an integer vectoras.list(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))# assume the following Java code:# public class ClassWithArrays {#   public boolean[] b = {true, false, true};#   public int[] i = {1, 2, 3};# }x &amp;lt;- new(&#39;ClassWithArrays&#39;); # see Java interop belowas.list(x)# gives: list(c(T,F,T), c(1L,2L,3L))For more details, please refer tothe executable specificationof the implicit and explicit foreign objects conversions.Note that R contexts started from other languages or Java (as opposed to via the bin/R script) will default to non-interactive mode, similar to bin/Rscript.This has implications on console output (results are not echoed) and graphics (output defaults to a file instead of a window), and some packages may behave differently in non-interactive mode.See the Polyglot Reference and theEmbedding documentationfor more information about interoperability with other programming languages.Bellow is a list of available FastR interoperability builtin functions.For more information see the FastR help pages or try the examples.&amp;gt; help(java.type)&amp;gt; ?java.type&amp;gt; example(java.type)  java.type  java.addToClasspath  is.polyglot.value  eval.polyglot  export  importInteroperability with Java and other JVM languagesGraalVM R engine provides built-in interoperability with Java.

The graphics package and most of its functions are not supported at the moment.The awt device is based on the Java Graphics2D object and users can pass it their own Graphics2D object instance when opening the device using the awt function, as shown in the Java interop example.When the Graphics2D object is not provided to awt, it opens a new window similarly to X11.The svg device in GraalVM implementation of R generates more lightweight SVG code than the svgimplementation in GNU R.Moreover, functions tailored to manipulate the SVG device are provided: svg.off and svg.string.The SVG device is demonstrated in the following code sample.

Moreover,the SHARED cluster is based on some assumptions about used R packages:  The native code must not mutate shared vectors (which is a discouraged practice).  The native code must be re-entrant (it can be executed from multiple threads,but for compatibility FastR allows only one thread to be executing native code).  If the package contains some global data other than R functions,these must not be mutated after the package was loaded.If the code that you want to parallelize does not match these expectations,you can still use the PSOCK cluster with the GraalVM R engine.The FORK cluster and functions depending solely on forking (e.g., mcparallel) are not supported at the moment.",

                    "content": "Class Initialization in Native ImageThe semantics of Java requires that a class is initialized the first time it is accessed at run time.Class initialization has negative consequences for ahead-of-time compilation of Java as:  It significantly degrades the performance of native images: Every class access (via field or method) requires a check if the class is already initialized. Without special optimizations, this can reduce performance by more than 2x.  It increases the amount of work to start the application. For example, the simple “Hello, World!” program requires initialization of more than 300 classes.To reduce the negative impact of class initialization, Native Image supports class initialization at build time: certain classes can be initialized during image building making run-time initialization and checks unnecessary.All the static state from initialized classes is stored into the image.Access to the static fields that were initialized at build time is transparent to the application and works as if the class was initialized at runtime.Specifying class initialization policies can be complicated due to the following constraints that come from class initialization semantics:  When a class is initialized all super classes and super interfaces with default methods must also be initialized.Interfaces without default methods, however, are not initialized. To describe this we will further use a short term “relevant supertype”, and relevant subtype for subtypes of classes and interfaces with default methods.  Relevant supertypes of types initialized at build time must also be initialized at build time.  Relevant subtypes of types initialized at run time must also be initialized at run time.  No instances classes that are initialized at run time must be present in the image.To have the out-of-the-box experience of Native Image and still get the benefits of build-time initailization, Native Image does three things:  Build-Time Initialization of the Native Image Runtime  Automatic Initialization of Safe Classes  Explicitly Specifying Class InitializationTo track which classes got initialized and why one can use the flag -H:+PrintClassInitialization.This flag greatly helps to configure the image build to work as intended; the goal is to have as many classes initialized at build time and yet keep the correct semantics of the program.Build-Time Initialization of the Native Image RuntimeIn the Native Image runtime most of the classes are initialized at image-build time.This includes the garbage collector, important JDK classes, the deoptimizer, etc.For all of the build-time initialized classes from the runtime, Native Image gives proper support so the semantics remains the same even if initialization happened at build time.If there is an issue with a JDK class behaving incorrectly because of class initialization at build time, please report an issue.Automatic Initialization of Safe ClassesFor application classes, the Native Image tries to find classes that can be safely initialized at build time.A class is considered safe if all of its relevant super types are safe and if the class’ initializer does not call any unsafe methods or initializes other unsafe classes.A method is considered as unsafe:  If it transitively calls into native code (e.g., System.out.println): native code is not analyzed so Native Image can’t know which illegal actions could of been performed.  If it calls methods that can’t be reduced to a single target (virtual methods).This restriction is there to avoid the explosion of search space for the safety analysis of static initializers.  If it is substituted by Native Image. Running initializers of substituted methods would yield different results in the hosting VM than in the produced image.As a result, the safety analysis would consider some methods safe but their execution would lead to illegal states.A test that shows examples of classes that are proven safe can be found here.The list of all classes that are proven safe is displayed in a file when -H:+PrintClassInitialization is set on the command line.Explicitly Specifying Class InitializationEach class can be initialized either (1) at run time, or (2) at build time.To specify class-initialization policies we provide two flags --initialize-at-build-time and --initialize-at-run-time.These flags allow specifying a policy for whole packages or individual classes.For example, if we have a classes p.C1, p.C2, … , p.Cn. We can eagerly initialize this package with  --initialize-at-build-time=pIf we want to delay one of the classes in package p we can simply add  --initialize-at-run-time=p.C1The whole class hierarchy can be initialized at build time by simply passing --initialize-at-build-time on the command line.Class initialization can also be specified programatically by using RuntimeClassInitialization from a Native Image feature.",

                    "content": "Assisted Configuration of Native Image BuildsNative images are built ahead of runtime and their build relies on a static analysis of which code will be reachable. However, this analysis cannot always completely predict all usages of the Java Native Interface (JNI), Java reflection, dynamic proxy objects (java.lang.reflect.Proxy) or class path resources (Class.getResource). Undetected usages of these dynamic features need to be provided to the native-image tool in the form of configuration files.In order to make preparing these configuration files easier and more convenient, GraalVM provides an agent that tracks all usages of dynamic features of an execution on a regular Java VM. It can be enabled on the command line of the GraalVM java command:/path/to/graalvm/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/ ...Note that -agentlib must be specified before a -jar option or a class name or any application parameters in the java command line.During execution, the agent interfaces with the Java VM to intercept all calls that look up classes, methods, fields, resources or request proxy accesses. The agent then generates the files jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json and resource-config.json in the specified output directory, which is /path/to/config-dir/ in the example above. The generated files are stand-alone configuration files in JSON format which contain all intercepted dynamic accesses.It can be necessary to run the target application more than once with different inputs to trigger separate execution paths for a better coverage of dynamic accesses. The agent supports this with the config-merge-dir option which adds the intercepted accesses to an existing set of configuration files:/path/to/graalvm/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=/path/to/config-dir/ ...                                                              ^^^^^If the specified target directory or configuration files in it are missing when using config-merge-dir, the agent creates them and prints a warning.By default the agent will write the configuration files after the JVM process terminates. In addition, the agent provides the following flags to write configuration files on a periodic basis.  config-write-period-secs: Executes a periodic write every number of seconds as specified in this configuration. Supports only integer values greater than zero.  config-write-initial-delay-secs: The number of seconds before the first write is schedule for execution. Supports only integer values greater or equal to zero. Enabled only if config-write-period-secs is greater than zero.For example:/path/to/graalvm/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/,config-write-period-secs=300,config-write-initial-delay-secs=5 ...It is advisable to manually review the generated configuration files. Because the agent observes only code that was executed, the resulting configurations can be missing elements that are used in other code paths. It could also make sense to simplify the generated configurations to make any future manual maintenance easier.The generated configuration files can be supplied to the native-image tool by placing them in a META-INF/native-image/ directory on the class path, for example, in a JAR file used in the image build. This directory (or any of its subdirectories) is searched for files with the names jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json and resource-config.json, which are then automatically included in the build. Not all of those files must be present. When multiple files with the same name are found, all of them are included.Advanced UsageCaller-based FiltersBy default, the agent filters dynamic accesses which native-image supports without configuration. The filter mechanism works by identifying the Java method performing the access, also referred to as caller method, and matching its declaring class against a sequence of filter rules. The built-in filter rules exclude dynamic accesses which originate in the Java VM or in parts of the Java class library directly supported by native-image (such as java.nio) from the generated configuration files. Which item (class, method, field, resource, …) is being accessed is not relevant for filtering.In addition to the built-in filter, custom filter files with additional rules can be specified using the caller-filter-file option, for example: -agentlib:caller-filter-file=/path/to/filter-file,config-output-dir=...Filter files have the following structure:{ &quot;rules&quot;: [    {&quot;excludeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.**&quot;},    {&quot;includeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.tutorial.*&quot;},    {&quot;excludeClasses&quot;: &quot;com.oracle.svm.tutorial.HostedHelper&quot;}  ]}The rules section contains a sequence of rules. Each rule specifies either includeClasses, which means that lookups originating in matching classes will be included in the resulting configuration, or excludeClasses, which excludes lookups originating in matching classes from the configuration. Each rule defines a pattern for the set of matching classes, which can end in .* or .**: a .* ending matches all classes in a package and that package only, while a .** ending matches all classes in the package as well as in all subpackages at any depth. Without .* or .**, the rule applies only to a single class with the qualified name that matches the pattern. All rules are processed in the sequence in which they are specified, so later rules can partially or entirely override earlier ones. When multiple filter files are provided (by specifying multiple caller-filter-file options), their rules are chained together in the order in which the files are specified. The rules of the built-in caller filter are always processed first, so they can be overridden in custom filter files.In the example above, the first rule excludes lookups originating in all classes from package com.oracle.svm and from all of its subpackages (and their subpackages, etc.) from the generated configuration. In the next rule however, lookups from those classes that are directly in package com.oracle.svm.tutorial are included again. Finally, lookups from the HostedHelper class is excluded again. Each of these rules partially overrides the previous ones. For example, if the rules were in the reverse order, the exclusion of com.oracle.svm.** would be the last rule and would override all other rules.For testing purposes, the built-in filter for Java class library lookups can be disabled by adding the no-builtin-caller-filter option, but the resulting configuration files are generally unsuitable for a native image build. Similarly, the built-in filter for Java VM-internal accesses based on heuristics can be disabled with no-builtin-heuristic-filter and will also generally lead to less usable configuration files. For example: -agentlib:native-image-agent=no-builtin-caller-filter,no-builtin-heuristic-filter,config-output-dir=...Access FiltersUnlike the caller-based filters described above, which filter dynamic accesses based on where they originate from, access filters apply to the target of the access. Therefore, access filters enable directly excluding packages and classes (and their members) from the generated configuration.By default, all accessed classes (which also pass the caller-based filters and the built-in filters) are included in the generated configuration. Using the access-filter-file option, a custom filter file that follows the file structure described above can be added. The option can be specified more than once to add multiple filter files and can be combined with the other filter options. For example: -agentlib:access-filter-file=/path/to/access-filter-file,caller-filter-file=/path/to/caller-filter-file,config-output-dir=...Specifying Configuration Files as native-image ArgumentsA directory containing configuration files that is not part of the class path can be specified to native-image via -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories=/path/to/config-dir/. This directory must directly contain all four files jni-config.json, reflect-config.json, proxy-config.json and resource-config.json. A directory with the same four configuration files that is on the class path, but not in META-INF/native-image/, can be provided via -H:ConfigurationResourceRoots=path/to/resources/. Both -H:ConfigurationFileDirectories and -H:ConfigurationResourceRoots can also take a comma-separated list of directories.Injecting the agent via the process environmentAltering the java command line to inject the agent can prove to be difficult if the Java process is launched by an application or script file or if Java is even embedded in an existing process. In that case, it is also possible to inject the agent via the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS environment variable. This environment variable can be picked up by multiple Java processes which run at the same time, in which case each agent must write to a separate output directory with config-output-dir. (The next section describes how to merge sets of configuration files.) In order to use separate paths with a single global JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS variable, the agent’s output path options support placeholders:export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=&quot;java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-output-dir-{pid}-{datetime}/&quot;The {pid} placeholder is replaced with the process identifier, while {datetime} is replaced with the system date and time in UTC, formatted according to ISO 8601. For the above example, the resulting path could be: /path/to/config-output-dir-31415-20181231T235950Z/.The Configuration ToolWhen using the agent in multiple processes at the same time as described in the previous section, config-output-dir is a safe option, but results in multiple sets of configuration files. The native-image-configure tool can be used to merge these configuration files. This tool must first be built with:native-image --tool:native-image-configureThen, the tool can be used to merge sets of configuration files as follows:native-image-configure generate --input-dir=/path/to/config-dir-0/ --input-dir=/path/to/config-dir-1/ --output-dir=/path/to/merged-config-dir/This command reads one set of configuration files from /path/to/config-dir-0/ and another from /path/to/config-dir-1/ and then writes a set of configuration files that contains both of their information to /path/to/merged-config-dir/.An arbitrary number of --input-dir arguments with sets of configuration files can be specified. See native-image-configure help for all options.Trace FilesIn the examples above, native-image-agent has been used to both keep track of the dynamic accesses in a Java VM and then to generate a set of configuration files from them. However, for a better understanding of the execution, the agent can also write a trace file in JSON format that contains each individual access:/path/to/graalvm/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=trace-output=/path/to/trace-file.json ...The native-image-configure tool can transform trace files to configuration files that can be used in native image builds. The following command reads and processes trace-file.json and generates a set of configuration files in directory /path/to/config-dir/:native-image-configure generate --trace-input=/path/to/trace-file.json --output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/InteroperabilityAlthough the agent is distributed with Graal VM, it uses the Java VM Tool Interface (JVMTI) and can potentially be used with other Java VMs that support JVMTI. In this case, it is necessary to provide the absolute path of the agent:/path/to/some/java -agentpath:/path/to/graalvm/jre/lib/amd64/libnative-image-agent.so=&amp;lt;options&amp;gt; ...",

To instead parse functionseagerly and be able to set breakpoints also in functions not yet executed you can use the optionlli --llvm.lazyParsing=false.Program-defined breakpoints using __builtin_debugtrap()The __builtin_debugtrap function enables you to mark locations in your program at which you explicitlywant GraalVM to halt the program and switch to the debugger. The debugger automatically halts at each callto this function as if a breakpoint were set on the call. You can use this feature to quickly reach thecode you are actually trying to debug without having to first find and set a breakpoint on it afterlaunching your application. You can also instruct Chrome Inspector not to suspend your program at the firstsource-level statement being executed.

For example,$ javac Hello.java$ mx native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1 HelloThe resulting image should contain code (method) debug records in aformat gdb understands (Windows support is still under development).At present it makes no difference which positive value is supplied asargument to the GenerateDebugInfo option.The GenerateDebugInfo option also enables caching of sources for anyJDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes and application classes which canbe located during native image generation. By default the cache iscreated under local subdirectory sources (a command line option can beused to specifiy an alternative location). It is used to configuresource file search path roots for the debugger. Files in the cache arelocated in a directory hierarchy that matches the file pathinformation included in the native image debug records. The sourcecache should contain all the files needed to debug the generated imageand nothing more. This local cache provides a convenient way of makingjust the necessary sources available to the debugger/IDE whendebugging a native image.The implementation tries to be smart about locating source files. Ituses the current JAVA_HOME to locate the JDK src.zip when searchingfor JDK runtime sources. It also uses entries in the classpath tosuggest locations for GraalVM source files and application sourcefiles (see below for precise details of the scheme used to identifysource locations). However, source layouts do vary and it may not bepossible to find all sources. Hence, users can specify the location ofsource files explicitly on the command line using optionDebugInfoSourceSearchPath:$ javac --source-path apps/greeter/src     -d apps/greeter/classes org/my/greeter/*Greeter.java$ javac -cp apps/greeter/classes     --source-path apps/hello/src     -d apps/hello/classes org/my/hello/Hello.java$ mx native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/src     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/greeter/src     -cp apps/hello/classes:apps/greeter/classes org.my.hello.HelloOption DebugInfoSourceSearchPath can be repeated as many times asrequired to notify all the target source locations. The value passedto this option can be either an absolute or relative path. It canidentify either a directory, a source jar or a source zip file. It isalso possible to specify several source roots at once using a commaseparator:$ mx native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar     -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar     org.my.HelloBy default the cache of application, GraalVM and JDK sources islocated under local directory sources. Option DebugInfoSourceCacheRootcan be used to specify an alternative location for the top leveldirectory. As an example, the following variant of the previouscommand specifies the same target but employs an absolute path:$ SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT=$PWD/sources$ mx native-image -H:GenerateDebugInfo=1     -H:DebugInfoSourceCacheRoot=$SOURCE_CACHE_ROOT     -H:DebugInfoSourceSearchPath=apps/hello/target/hello-sources.jar,apps/greeter/target/greeter-sources.jar     -cp apps/target/hello.jar:apps/target/greeter.jar     org.my.HelloIf you specify a root directory that does not yet exist it will becreated during population of the cache.Note that in all the examples above the DebugInfoSourceSearchPathoptions are actually redundant. In the first case the classpathentries for apps/hello/classes and apps/greeter/classes will be usedto derive the default search roots apps/hello/src andapps/greeter/src. In the second case classpath entriesapps/target/hello.jar and apps/target/greeter.jar will be used toderive the default search roots apps/target/hello-sources.jar andapps/target/greeter-sources.jar.What is currently implementedThe currently implemented features include:  break points configured by file and line or by method name  single stepping by line including both into and over function calls  stack backtraces (not including frames detailing inlined code)Note that single stepping within a compiled method includes file andline number info for inlined code, including inlined Graal methods.So, gdb may switch files even though you are still in the samecompiled method.Identifying the location of source codeOne goal of the implementation is to make it simple to configure yourdebugger so that it can identify the relevant source file when itstops during program execution. The native image generator tries toachieve this by accumulating the relevant sources in a suitablystructured file cache.The native image generator uses different strategies to locate sourcefiles for JDK runtime classes, GraalVM classes and application sourceclasses for inclusion in the local sources cache. It identifies whichstrategy to use based on the package name of the class. So, forexample, packages starting with java.* or jdk.* are JDK classes;packages starting with org.graal.* or com.oracle.svm.* are GraalVMclasses; any other packages are regarded as application classes.Sources for JDK runtime classes are retrieved from the src.zip foundin the JDK release used to run the native image generation process.Retrieved files are cached under subdirectory sources/jdk, using themodule name (for JDK11) and package name of the associated class todefine the directory hierarchy in which the source is located.So, for example, on Linux the source for class java.util.HashMap willbe cached in file sources/jdk/java.base/java/util/HashMap.java. Debuginfo records for this class and its methods will identify this sourcefile using the relative directory path java.base/java/util and filename HashMap.java. On Windows things will be the same modulo use of‘&#39; rather than ‘/’ as the file separator.Sources for GraalVM classes are retrieved from zip files or sourcedirectories derived from entries in the classpath. Retrieved files arecached under subdirectory sources/graal, using the package name of theassociated class to define the directory hierarchy in which the sourceis located (e.g. class com.oracle.svm.core.VM has its source filecached at sources/graal/com/oracle/svm/core/VM.java).The lookup scheme for cached GraalVM sources varies depending uponwhat is found in each classpath entry. Given a jar file entry like/path/to/foo.jar, the corresponding file /path/to/foo.src.zip isconsidered as a candidate zip file system from which source files maybe extracted. When the entry specifies a dir like /path/to/bar thendirectories /path/to/bar/src and /path/to/bar/src_gen are consideredas candidates. Candidates are skipped when i) the zip file or sourcedirectory does not exist or ii) it does not contain at least onesubdirectory hierarchy that matches one of the the expected GraalVMpackage hierarchies.Sources for application classes are retrieved from source jar files orsource directories derived from entries in the classpath. Retrievedfiles are cached under subdirectory sources/src, using the packagename of the associated class to define the directory hierarchy inwhich the source is located (e.g. class org.my.foo.Foo has itssource file cached as sources/src/org/my/foo/Foo.java).The lookup scheme for cached Application sources varies depending uponwhat is found in each classpath entry. Given a jar file entry like/path/to/foo.jar, the corresponding jar /path/to/foo-sources.jar isconsidered as a candidate zip file system from which source files maybe extracted. When the entry specifies a dir like /path/to/bar/classesor /path/to/bar/target/classes then one of the directories/path/to/bar/src/main/java, /path/to/bar/src/java or /path/to/bar/srcis selected as a candidate (in that order of preference). Finally, thecurrent directory in which the native image program is being run isalso considered as a candidate.These lookup strategies are only provisional and may need extending infuture. Note however that it is possible to make missing sourcesavailable by other means. One option is to unzip extra app source jarsor copying extra app source trees into the cache. Another is toconfigure extra source search paths (see below).Configuring source paths in gdbIn order for gdb to be able to locate the source files for your appclasses, Graal classes and JDK runtime classes you need to provide gdbwith a list of source root dirs using the ‘set directories’ command:(gdb) set directories /path/to/sources/jdk:/path/to/sources/graal:/path/to/sources/srcDirectory …/sources/jdk should contain source files for all JDK runtimeclasses referenced from debug records.Directory …/sources/graal should contain source files for all GraalVMclasses referenced from debug records. Note that the currentimplementation does not yet find some sources for the GraalVM JITcompiler in the org.graalvm.compiler* package subspace.Directory …/sources/src should contain source files for allapplication classes referenced from debug records, assuming they canbe located using the lookup strategy described above.You can supplement the files cached in sources/src by unzippingapplication source jars or copying application source trees into thecache. You need to ensure that any new subdirectory you add tosources/src corresponds to the top level package for the classes whosesources are being included.You can also add extra directories to the search path. Note that gdbdoes not understand zip format file systems so any extra entries youadd must identify a directory tree containing the relevantsources. Once again. top level entries in the directory added to thesearch path must correspond to the top level package for the classeswhose sources are being included.Configuring source paths in VSTO BE ADDEDChecking debug info on Linuxn.b. this is only of interest to those who want to understand how thedebug info implementation works or want to trouble shoot problemsencountered during debugging that might relate to the debug infoencoding.The objdump command can be used to display the debug info embeddedinto a native image. The following commands (which all assume thetarget binary is called hello) can be used to display all currentlygenerated content:$ objdump --dwarf=info hello &amp;gt; info$ objdump --dwarf=abbrev hello &amp;gt; abbrev$ objdump --dwarf=ranges hello &amp;gt; ranges$ objdump --dwarf=decodedline hello &amp;gt; decodedline$ objdump --dwarf=rawline hello &amp;gt; rawline$ objdump --dwarf=str hello &amp;gt; str$ objdump --dwarf=frames hello &amp;gt; framesThe info section includes details of all compiled Java methods.The abbrev section defines the layout of records in the info sectionthat describe Java files (compilation units) and methods.The ranges section details the start and end addresses of methodcode segmentsThe decodedline section maps subsegments of method code rangesegments to files and line numbers. This mapping includes entriesfor files and line numbers for inlined methods.The rawline segment provides details of how the line table isgenerated using DWARF state machine instructions that encode file,line and address transitions.The str section provides a lookup table for strings referencedfrom records in the info sectionThe frames section lists transition points in compiled methodswhere a (fixed size) stack frame is pushed or popped, allowingthe debugger to identify each frame’s current and previous stackpointers and it’s return address.Note that some of the content embedded in the debug records isgenerated by the C compiler and belongs to code that is either inlibraries or the C lib bootstrap code that is bundled in with theJava method code.Currently supported targetsThe prototype is currently implemented only for gdb on Linux.      Linux/x86_64 support has been tested and should workcorrectly.        Linux/AArch64 support is present but has not yet been fullyverified (break points should work ok but stack backtracesmay be incorrect).  Windows support is still under development.",

   static Comparator createProxyInstanceFromConstantArray() {        ClassLoader classLoader = ProxyFactory.class.getClassLoader();        InvocationHandler handler = new ProxyInvocationHandler();        return (Comparator) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);    }}Note: The analysis operates on Graal graphs and not source code.Therefore the following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayPreInitialized = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayLiteral = {java.util.Comparator.class};private static final Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfacesArrayPostInitialized = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[1];static {    interfacesArrayPostInitialized[0] = java.util.Comparator.class;}However, in Java there are no immutable arrays.Even if the array is declared as static final its contents can change later on.The simple analysis that we employ here doesn’t track further changes to the array.New array:class ProxyFactory {    static Comparator createProxyInstanceFromNewArray() {        ClassLoader classLoader = ProxyFactory.class.getClassLoader();        InvocationHandler handler = new ProxyInvocationHandler();        Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};        return (Comparator) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);    }}Note: Just like with constant arrays, the following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{java.util.Comparator.class};Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[1];interfaces[0] = Question.class;Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = {java.util.Comparator.class};The static analysis covers code patterns most frequently used to define dynamic proxy classes.For the exceptional cases where the analysis cannot discover the interface array there is also a manual dynamic proxy configuration mechanism.Manual configurationDynamic proxy classes can be generated at native image build time by specifying the list of interfaces that they implement.Substrate VM provides two options for this purpose: -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationFiles=&amp;lt;comma-separated-config-files&amp;gt; and -H:DynamicProxyConfigurationResources=&amp;lt;comma-separated-config-resources&amp;gt;.These options accept JSON files whose structure is an array of arrays of fully qualified interface names.Example:[    [&quot;java.lang.AutoCloseable&quot;, &quot;java.util.Comparator&quot;],    [&quot;java.util.Comparator&quot;],    [&quot;java.util.List&quot;]]The java.lang.reflect.Proxy API also allows creation of a dynamic proxy that doesn’t implement any user provided interfaces.Therefore the following is a valid configuration:[    []]In this case the generated dynamic proxy class only implements java.lang.reflect.Proxy.Dynamic proxy classes in static initializersDynamic proxy classes and instances of dynamic proxy classes that are defined in static initializers can be accessed at runtime without any special handling.This is possible since the static initializers are executed at native image build time.For example this will work:private final static Comparator proxyInstance;private final static Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; proxyClass;static {    ClassLoader classLoader = ProxyFactory.class.getClassLoader();    InvocationHandler handler = new ProxyInvocationHandler();    Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] interfaces = {java.util.Comparator.class};    proxyInstance = (Comparator) Proxy.newProxyInstance(classLoader, interfaces, handler);    proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(classLoader, interfaces);}",

                    "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsThis file lists frequently asked questions and answers around GraalVM JavaScript.CompatibilityMy application used to run on Nashorn, it does not work on GraalVM JavaScriptReason:  GraalVM JavaScript tries to be compatible to the ECMAScript specification, as well as competing engines (including Nashorn). In some cases, this is a contradicting requirement; then, ECMAScript is given precedence. Also, there are cases where GraalVM Javascript is not exactly replicating Nashorn features intentionally, e.g. for security reasons.Solution:  In many cases, enabling GraalVM’s “Nashorn compatibility mode” enables features not enabled by default. Note that this can have negative effects on application security! See NashornMigrationGuide.md for details.Specific applications:  For JSR 223 ScriptEngine, you might want to set the system property polyglot.js.nashorn-compat to true in order to use the Nashorn compatibility mode  For ant, use ANT_OPTS=&quot;-Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true&quot; ant when using GraalVM JavaScript via ScriptEnginePerformanceMy application is slower on GraalVM JavaScript than on [another engine]Reason:  Ensure your benchmark considers warmup. During the first few iterations, GraalVM JavaScript will be slower than natively implemented engines, while on peak performance, this difference should level out.  GraalVM JavaScript is shipped in two different modes: native (default) and JVM. While the default of native offers fast startup, it might show slower peak performance once the application is warmed up. In the JVM mode, the application might need a few hundred milliseconds more to start, but typically shows better peak performance.Solution:  Use proper warmup in your benchmark, and disregard the first few iterations where the application still warms up.  Use the --jvm option for slower startup, but higher peak performance.  Try to minify the problem to the root cause, and file an issue so the GraalVM team can have a look.ErrorsTypeError: Access to host class com.myexample.MyClass is not allowed or does not existReason:  You are trying to access a Java class that is not known to the js or node process, or is not among the allowed classes your code can access.Solution:  Ensure there is no typo in the class name.  Ensure the class is on the classpath. Use the --vm.cp=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt; option of the launchers.  Ensure access to the class is permitted, by having @HostAccess.Export on your class and/or the Context.Builder.allowHostAccess() set to a permissive setting.

                    "content": "Frequently Asked QuestionsDoes module/package XYZ work on GraalPython?It depends, but is currently unlikely. Our first goal with GraalPython was toshow that we can run NumPy and related packages using the managed GraalVM LLVMimplementation. Now that we have done so we are hard at work to improve thenumber of passing CPython unittests. We are also beginning to track ourcompatibility with popular PyPI packages and expect to increase our coveragethere soon.Can GraalPython replace my Jython use case?We hope it can, but there are some caveats, like Python code subclassing Javaclasses or use through the javax.script.ScriptEngine not beingsupported. Please see our migration document for details.Do I need to compile and run native modules as LLVM bitcode to use GraalPython?If you want to run C extensions or use certain built-in features, yes, you needto build the module with GraalPython and then it will run using the GraalVM LLVMruntime. However, many of the core features of Python (including e.g. largeparts of the os API) are implemented in pure Java and many standard librarymodules and packages work without running any LLVM bitcode. So even thoughGraalPython depends on GraalVM LLVM, for many use cases you can disallow nativemodules entirely.Can I use GraalVM sandboxing features with GraalPython?Yes! As an embedder, you can selectively disable features. As an example, youcan disable native code execution or filesystem access. If you are a user ofGraalVM Enterprise Edition, you will also find that the managed execution modefor LLVM fully works for running extensions such as NumPy in a safer manner.Do all the GraalVM polyglot features work?We are doing our best to ensure the polyglot features of GraalVM work as aPython user would expect. There are still many cases where expectations areunclear or where multiple behaviors are imaginable. We are actively looking atuse cases and are continuously evolving the implementation to provide the mostconvenient and least surprising behavior.What is the performance I can expect from GraalPython?For pure Python code, performance after warm-up can be expected to be around 5-6times faster than CPython 3.8 (or 6-7x faster than Jython). For nativeextensions running as LLVM bitcode, we are currently slower than CPython - youcan expect to see between 0.1x and 0.5x performance.I heard languages with JIT compilers have slow startup. Is that true for GraalPython?It depends. When you use the GraalVM native image feature with GraalPython oruse the GraalPython launcher in GraalVM its startup is competitive withCPython. In any case, both with native image or when running on JVM we firstneed to warm up to reach peak performance. This is a complicated story initself, but in general it can take a while (a minute or two) after you havereached and are running your core workload. We are continuously working onimproving this.Can I share warmed up code between multiple Python contexts?Yes, this works, and you will find that starting up multiple contexts in thesame engine and running the same or similar code in them will get increasinglyfaster, because the compiled code is shared across contexts. However, the peakperformance in this setup is currently lower than in the single context case.",

                    "content": "Implementing Native Methods in Java with Substrate VMSubstrate VM can be used to implement low-level system operations in Java andmake them available via JNI to Java code executing on a standard JVM. Asa result one can use the same language to write the application logicas well as the system calls.Note that this document describes the opposite of what is commonly done via JNI:Usually low-level system operations are implemented in C and invoked from Javausing JNI. If you are interested in how Substrate VM supports the common use case,read the documentation about Substrate VM JNI support instead.Create a Shared LibraryFirst of all one has to use the native-image command to generate a shared librarywith some JNI-compatible entry points.Let’s start with the Java code:package org.pkg.implnative;import org.graalvm.nativeimage.c.function.CEntryPoint;import org.graalvm.word.Pointer;public final class NativeImpl {    @CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add&quot;)    public static int add(Pointer jniEnv, Pointer clazz, @CEntryPoint.IsolateThreadContext long isolateId, int a, int b) {        return a + b;    }}After being processed by the native-image command the codeexposes a C function Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add(the name follows conventions of JNI that will be handy later) anda SubstrateVM signature typical for JNI methods. The first parameteris a reference to JNIEnv* value, the second parameter is a referenceto the jclass value for the class declaring the method. The third parameter is aportable (e.g. long) identifier of the SubstrateVM isolatethread.The rest of the parameters are the actual parameters of the Java Native.addmethod described in the next section. Compile the code with shared option on:$GRAALVM/bin/native-image --shared -H:Name=libnativeimpl -cp nativeimpland the libnativeimpl.so is generated. We are ready to use it from standardJava code.Bind Java Native MethodNow we need another Java class to use the native library generated in the previous step:package org.pkg.apinative;public final class Native {    private static native int add(long isolateThreadId, int a, int b);}the package name of the class as well as name of the method has to correspond(after the JNI mangling)to the name of the @CEntryPoint introduced previously. The first argument isa portable (e.g. long) identifier of the SubstrateVM isolate thread. The rest of the argumentsmatches the parameters of the entry point.Loading the Native LibraryThe next step is to bind the JDK with the generated .so library - e.g.make sure the implementation of the native Native.add method is loaded.Simple load or loadLibrary calls will do:public static void main(String[] args) {    System.loadLibrary(&quot;nativeimpl&quot;);    // ...}under the assumption your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable is specifiedor java.library.path Java property is properly set.Initializing the Substrate VMBefore making calls to the Native.add method, we need to create a Substrate VMisolate. Substrate VM provides special built-in to allow that:CEntryPoint.Builtin.CreateIsolate. Define another method along your otherexisting @CEntryPoint methods. Let it return long and take no parameters:public final class NativeImpl {    @CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_createIsolate&quot;, builtin=CEntryPoint.Builtin.CreateIsolate)    public static native long createIsolate();}SubstrateVM then generates default native implementation of themethod into the final .so library.The method initializes the Substrate VM runtime andreturns a portable identification - e.g. long to holdan instance of a Substrate VM isolatethread. The isolate thread can then be used formultiple invocations of the native part of our code:package org.pkg.apinative;public final class Native {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.loadLibrary(&quot;nativeimpl&quot;);        long isolateThread = createIsolate();        System.out.println(&quot;2 + 40 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 2, 40));        System.out.println(&quot;12 + 30 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 12, 30));        System.out.println(&quot;20 + 22 = &quot; + add(isolateThread, 20, 22));    }    private static native int add(long isolateThread, int a, int b);    private static native long createIsolate();}The standard JVM is started. It initializes a Substrate VM isolate,attaches current thread to the isolate and the universal answer 42 isthen computed three times inside of the isolate.Calling JVM from Native JavaThere is a detailed tutorial on the C interfaceof Substrate VM. Rather than repeating it here, let’s apply some of itsprinciples to a related topic, the implementation of native methods. Let’s makea callback to JVM!In the classical setup, when C needs to call into JVM, it uses jni.hheader file. The file defines essential JVM structures (like JNIEnv) as well asfunctions one can invoke to inspect classes, access fields, and call methodsin the JVM. In order to call these functions from our NativeImpl class in ourexample, we need to define appropriate Java API wrappers of the jni.h concepts:@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(value = &quot;JNIEnv_&quot;, addStructKeyword = true)interface JNIEnvironment extends PointerBase {    @CField(&quot;functions&quot;)    JNINativeInterface getFunctions();}@CPointerTo(JNIEnvironment.class)interface JNIEnvironmentPointer extends PointerBase {    JNIEnvironment read();    void write(JNIEnvironment value);}@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(value = &quot;JNINativeInterface_&quot;, addStructKeyword = true)interface JNINativeInterface extends PointerBase {    @CField    GetMethodId getGetStaticMethodID();    @CField    CallStaticVoidMethod getCallStaticVoidMethodA();}interface GetMethodId extends CFunctionPointer {    @InvokeCFunctionPointer    JMethodID find(JNIEnvironment env, JClass clazz, CCharPointer name, CCharPointer sig);}interface JObject extends PointerBase {}interface CallStaticVoidMethod extends CFunctionPointer {    @InvokeCFunctionPointer    void call(JNIEnvironment env, JClass cls, JMethodID methodid, JValue args);}interface JClass extends PointerBase {}interface JMethodID extends PointerBase {}If we leave aside the meaning of JNIHeaderDirectives for now, the restof the interfaces is a type-safe representation of the C pointers found in thejni.h file. JClass, JMethodID, JObject are all pointers. Thanks tothe above definitions we now have Java interfaces to representinstances of these objects in our native Java code in a type safe way.The core part of any JNI API is the set of functions one can callwhen talking to the JVM. There are dozens of them, but in the JNINativeInterfacedefinition we just define wrappers for those few that we need in our example.Again, we give them proper types, so in our native Java code we can useGetMethodId.find(...), CallStaticVoidMethod.call(...), etc. In addition,there is another important part missing in the puzzle - the jvalue union typewrapping all the possible Java primitive and object types. Here comes definitionof its getters and setters:@CContext(JNIHeaderDirectives.class)@CStruct(&quot;jvalue&quot;)interface JValue extends PointerBase {    @CField boolean z();    @CField byte b();    @CField char c();    @CField short s();    @CField int i();    @CField long j();    @CField float f();    @CField double d();    @CField JObject l();    @CField void z(boolean b);    @CField void b(byte b);    @CField void c(char ch);    @CField void s(short s);    @CField void i(int i);    @CField void j(long l);    @CField void f(float f);    @CField void d(double d);    @CField void l(JObject obj);    JValue addressOf(int index);}The addressOf method is a special Substrate VM construct used to performC pointer arithmetics. Given a pointer one can treat it as initial element ofan array, then for example, use addressOf(1) to access the subsequent element.With this we have all the API we need to make a callback: let’s redefinethe previously introduced NativeImpl.add method to accept properly typedpointers, and then use these pointers to invoke a JVM method before computingthe sum of a + b:@CEntryPoint(name = &quot;Java_org_pkg_apinative_Native_add&quot;)static int add(JNIEnvironment env, JClass clazz, @CEntryPoint.IsolateThreadContext long isolateThreadId, int a, int b) {    JNINativeInterface fn = env.getFunctions();    try (        CTypeConversion.CCharPointerHolder name = CTypeConversion.toCString(&quot;hello&quot;);        CTypeConversion.CCharPointerHolder sig = CTypeConversion.toCString(&quot;(ZCBSIJFD)V&quot;);    ) {        JMethodID helloId = fn.getGetStaticMethodID().find(env, clazz, name.get(), sig.get());        JValue args = StackValue.get(8, JValue.class);        args.addressOf(0).z(false);        args.addressOf(1).c(&#39;A&#39;);        args.addressOf(2).b((byte)22);        args.addressOf(3).s((short)33);        args.addressOf(4).i(39);        args.addressOf(5).j(Long.MAX_VALUE / 2l);        args.addressOf(6).f((float) Math.PI);        args.addressOf(7).d(Math.PI);        fn.getCallStaticVoidMethodA().call(env, clazz, helloId, args);    }    return a + b;}The above example seeks a static method hello and invokes it with eightJValue parameters in an array reserved by StackValue.geton the stack. Individual parameters are accessed by use ofthe addressOf operator and filled with appropriate primitive valuesbefore the call happens. The method hello is defined in the class Nativeand just prints values of all parameters to verify they are properlypropagated from the NativeImpl.add caller:public class Native {    public static void hello(boolean z, char c, byte b, short s, int i, long j, float f, double d) {        System.err.println(&quot;Hi, I have just been called back!&quot;);        System.err.print(&quot;With: &quot; + z + &quot; &quot; + c + &quot; &quot; + b + &quot; &quot; + s);        System.err.println(&quot; and: &quot; + i + &quot; &quot; + j + &quot; &quot; + f + &quot; &quot; + d);    }There is just one final piece to explain: the JNIHeaderDirectives.Substrate VM C interface needs to understand the layout of the C structures. Itneeds to know at which offset of JNINativeInterface structure it can findthe pointer to GetMethodId function. To do so, it needs jni.h and additionalfiles during compilation. One can specify them by @CContext annotation andimplementation of its Directives:final class JNIHeaderDirectives implements CContext.Directives {    @Override    public List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; getOptions() {        File[] jnis = findJNIHeaders();        return Arrays.asList(&quot;-I&quot; + jnis[0].getParent(), &quot;-I&quot; + jnis[1].getParent());    }    @Override    public List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; getHeaderFiles() {        File[] jnis = findJNIHeaders();        return Arrays.asList(&quot;&amp;lt;&quot; + jnis[0] + &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; + jnis[1] + &quot;&amp;gt;&quot;);    }    private static File[] findJNIHeaders() throws IllegalStateException {        final File jreHome = new File(System.getProperty(&quot;java.home&quot;));        final File include = new File(jreHome.getParentFile(), &quot;include&quot;);        final File[] jnis = {            new File(include, &quot;jni.h&quot;),            new File(new File(include, &quot;linux&quot;), &quot;jni_md.h&quot;),        };        return jnis;    }}The good thing is that jni.h is inside of every JDK, so one can use thejava.home property to locate the necessary header files. The actual logiccan, of course, be made more robust and OS-independent.Implementing any JVM native method in Java and/or making callbacks to the JVMwith Substrate VM should now be as easy as expanding upon the given exampleand invoking native-image.",

                    "content": "Truffle Interop 2.0It is recommended to read the Truffle Library Tutorial first, before proceeding. This document is targeted at guest language and tool implementers.MotivationIn Truffle Version 1.0 RC15 we introduced a new API called Truffle Libraries. Truffle Libraries allow using polymorphism with support for profiling/caching. With Interop 2.0 we plan to use Truffle Libraries for the interoperability protocol. The current interop APIs are mature and well tested and already adopted by languages and tools. So why change them and introduce Interop 2.0?Here is a list of arguments to justify the change:  Footprint: In the current interop API every message send goes through a CallTarget and the arguments are boxed into an Object[]. This makes current interop inefficient for interpreter calls and it requires additional memory. Truffle Libraries use simple nodes and type specialized call signatures that don’t require argument array boxing or call targets.  Uncached Dispatch: There is no way to execute current interop messages from the slow-path without allocating a temporary node. Truffle Libraries automatically generate an uncached version of every exported message. This allows the use of interop messages from slow-path/runtime without allocating any temporary data structures.  Reuse dispatch for multiple messages: In current interop, the dispatch to exported messages is repeated for each message that is sent. If multiple messages need to be sent and the receiver type becomes polymorphic this produces bad code. Interop libraries instances can be specialized for input values. This allows to do the dispatch once and invoke multiple messages without repeating the dispatch. This leads to more efficient code in polymorphic cases.  Support for default implementations: Current interop can only be used for implementations of TruffleObject. Truffle Libraries can be used with any receiver type. For example, it is possible to invoke the isExecutable message on primitive numbers and it just returns false.  Error Proneness: There were some common issues with message resolutions that Truffle Libraries try to avoid by not making them possible, such as mixing up receiver types or implementing a wrong type check. The new assertion feature for Truffle Libraries allows specifying message specific assertions that allow verifying invariants, pre, and post-conditions.  Redundancy in documentation: Current interop documents the messages in the Message constant and in the ForeignAccess static accessor method. This leads to mostly redundant documentation. With truffle interop, there is only one place for the documentation, which is the instance method in the library class.  Generality: Truffle Libraries can be used for language representation abstractions, as it is now efficient enough in terms of memory consumption and interpreter performance. The current interop API could not be realistically be used that way because of that.  Address Protocol Issues: There are some design issues with the current interop API that interop 2.0 tries to address (see later).CompatibilityThe change from interop 1.0 to 2.0 was done in a compatible way. Therefore, the old interop should continue to work and adoption can be incremental. This means that if one language still calls using the old interop API and the other language has already adopted the new interop API, a compatibility bridge will map the APIs. If you are curious about how this works, look for the class DefaultTruffleObjectExports for new interop calls to old interop. And LegacyToLibraryNode for old interop calls to new interop. Note that using the compatibility bridge may cause performance regressions. That is why languages should migrate as early as possible.Interop protocol changesInterop 2.0 comes with many protocol changes. This section is intended to provide rationales for these changes. For fully detailed reference documentation see the InteropLibrary Javadoc. Note that also every deprecated API describes its migration path in the Javadoc tagged by @deprecated.Replace IS_BOXED and UNBOX with explicit types.There are some problems with the IS_BOXED/UNBOX design:  In order to find out if a value is of a particular type, e.g. a String, the value needs to be unboxed first. Unboxing may be an expensive operation leading to inefficient code just to check the type of a value.  The old API cannot be used for values that did not implement TruffleObject. Therefore, the handling of primitive numbers needed to be separated from the TruffleObject case, making the UNBOX design necessary to reuse existing code. TruffleLibraries support primitive receiver types.  The design of UNBOX relies on the specified set of primitive types that it returns. It is hard to introduce additional new interop types this way, as language refers to the primitive types directly.The following new messages were introduced in InteropLibrary as a replacement:boolean isBoolean(Object)boolean asBoolean(Object)boolean isString(Object)String  asString(Object)boolean isNumber(Object)boolean fitsInByte(Object)boolean fitsInShort(Object)boolean fitsInInt(Object)boolean fitsInLong(Object)boolean fitsInFloat(Object)boolean fitsInDouble(Object)byte asByte(Object)short asShort(Object)int asInt(Object)long asLong(Object)float asFloat(Object)double asDouble(Object)The InteropLibrary specifies default implementations for the receiver types Boolean, Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double, Character and String. This design is extendable to support new values like big numbers or a custom String abstraction as Java primitive types are no longer directly used. It is no longer recommended to use primitive types in specializations directly as the set of interop primitive types may change in the future. Instead, always use the interop library to check for a particular type, e.g. use fitsInInt instead of instanceof Integer.By using the new messages it is possible to emulate the original UNBOX message like this:@Specialization(limit=&quot;5&quot;)Object doUnbox(Object value, @CachedLibrary(&quot;value&quot;) InteropLibrary interop) {    if (interop.isBoolean(value)) {      return interop.asBoolean(value);    } else if (interop.isString(value)) {      return interop.asString(value);    } else if (interop.isNumber(value)) {      if (interop.fitsInByte(value)) {        return interop.asByte(value);      } else if (interop.fitsInShort(value)) {        return interop.asShort(value);            } else if (interop.fitsInInt(value)) {        return interop.asInt(value);            } else if (interop.fitsInLong(value)) {        return interop.asLong(value);            } else if (interop.fitsInFloat(value)) {        return interop.asFloat(value);            } else if (interop.fitsInDouble(value)) {        return interop.asDouble(value);            }     }    throw UnsupportedMessageException.create();}Note it is not recommended to unbox all primitive types like this. Instead a language should only unbox to the primitive types it actually uses. Ideally an unbox operation is not needed and the interop library is directly used to implement the operation, like this:@Specialization(guards = {                &quot;leftValues.fitsInLong(l)&quot;,                &quot;rightValues.fitsInLong(r)&quot;}, limit=&quot;5&quot;)long doAdd(Object l, Object r,              @CachedLibrary(&quot;l&quot;) InteropLibrary leftValues,              @CachedLibrary(&quot;r&quot;) InteropLibrary rightValues) {       return leftValues.asLong(l) + rightValues.asLong(r);}Explicit Namespaces for Array and Member elementsThe generic READ and WRITE messages were originally designed with primarily JavaScript use-cases in mind. With the adoption of interop by more languages, it became apparent that there is a need for explicit namespaces for arrays and object members. Over time, the interpretation of READ and WRITE was changed to represent array accesses when used with numbers and object member accesses when used with strings. The HAS_SIZE message was reinterpreted as whether the value contains array elements with additional guarantees, e.g. that array elements were iterable between index 0 and size.For better interop between languages, there is a need for an explicit Hash/Map/Dictionary entry namespace. Originally it was intended to reuse the generic READ/WRITE namespace for this. For JavaScript, this was possible, as the dictionary and member namespaces were equivalent. Most languages, however, separate Map entries from Object members, which leads to ambiguous keys. It is not possible for the source language (the protocol implementer) to know how this conflict needs to be resolved. Instead, by having explicit namespaces we can let the target language (the protocol caller) decide how to resolve the ambiguity. For example, whether dictionary or member elements should take precedence can now be decided in the target language operation.The following interop messages were changed:READ, WRITE, REMOVE, HAS_SIZE, GET_SIZE, HAS_KEYS, KEYSThe updated protocol with separate member and array namespace in InteropLibrary looks like this:Object namespace:hasMembers(Object)getMembers(Object, boolean)readMember(Object, String)writeMember(Object, String, Object)removeMember(Object, String)invokeMember(Object, String, Object...)Array namespace:hasArrayElements(Object)readArrayElement(Object, long)getArraySize(Object)writeArrayElement(Object, long, Object)removeArrayElement(Object, long)Array access messages no longer throw UnknownIdentifierException but InvalidArrayIndexException. This was a bug in the original design, where the accessed number needed to be converted to the identifier string in the UnknownIdentifierException.Replaced KeyInfo with individual messagesIn the previous section, we did not mention the KEY_INFO message. The KEY_INFO message was useful to query all properties of a member or array element. While this was a convenient small API, it was often inefficient as it required the implementer to return all the key info properties. At the same time, it is rare that the caller really needed all key info properties. With Interop 2.0 we removed the KEY_INFO message. Instead, we introduced explicit messages for each namespace, to address this issue.Object namespace:isMemberReadable(Object, String)isMemberModifiable(Object, String)isMemberInsertable(Object, String)isMemberRemovable(Object, String)isMemberInvocable(Object, String)isMemberInternal(Object, String)isMemberWritable(Object, String)isMemberExisting(Object, String)hasMemberReadSideEffects(Object, String)hasMemberWriteSideEffects(Object, String)Array namespace:isArrayElementReadable(Object, long)isArrayElementModifiable(Object, long)isArrayElementInsertable(Object, long)isArrayElementRemovable(Object, long)isArrayElementWritable(Object, long)isArrayElementExisting(Object, long)Note that the array namespace does no longer support querying for read or write side-effects. We might reintroduce these messages, but at the moment there was no use-case. Also, the array namespace does not allow invocations.Remove return type for TO_NATIVEThe TO_NATIVE message was renamed to toNative in the InteropLibrary with the difference that it no longer returns a value, but performs the native transition as a side-effect if supported by the receiver. This allows the caller of the message to simplify their code. We found that in no cases the toNative transition required to return a different value. The default behavior fo toNative was changed to not return any value.Minor ChangesThe following messages were mostly unchanged. The NEW message was renamed to instantiate to be consistent with isInstantiable.Message.IS_NULL         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isNullMessage.EXECUTE         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.executeMessage.IS_INSTANTIABLE -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isInstantiableMessage.NEW             -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.instantiateMessage.IS_EXECUTABLE   -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isExecutableMessage.EXECUTE         -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.executeMessage.IS_POINTER      -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.isPointerMessage.AS_POINTER      -&amp;gt; InteropLibrary.asPointerStronger AssertionsMany new assertions were introduced as part of the migration. The concrete pre-post and invariant conditions are described in the Javadoc. Unlike the old interop nodes, cached libraries can only be used when adopted as part of the AST.No more unchecked checked exceptions.With Interop 2.0 InteropException.raise was deprecated. While possible, it is considered an anti-pattern to rethrow checked exceptions as unchecked exceptions. With TruffleLibraries the target language nodes are directly inserted into the AST of the caller so there is no longer a limiting CallTarget that does not support checked exceptions. Together with additional support for checked Exceptions from Truffle DSL, it should no longer be necessary to use the raise methods. Instead, a new create factory method was introduced for all interop exception types.It is planned to remove stack traces from interop exceptions in order to improve their efficiency, as interop exceptions are intended to be always immediately caught and never be rethrown. This was deferred until the compatibility layer can be removed.MigrationWith the use of Truffle Libraries for interop, most existing interop APIs had to be deprecated.The following comparison of Interop 1.0 with Interop 2.0 is designed to help to migrate existing uses of interop.Fast-Path Sending Interop MessagesThis is the fast-path way of sending interop messages embedded in an operation node. This is the most common way of sending interop messages.Interop 1.0:@ImportStatic({Message.class, ForeignAccess.class})abstract static class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;sendIsExecutable(isExecutableNode, function)&quot;)    Object doDefault(TruffleObject function, Object[] arguments,                    @Cached(&quot;IS_EXECUTABLE.createNode()&quot;) Node isExecutableNode,                    @Cached(&quot;EXECUTE.createNode()&quot;) Node executeNode) {        try {            return ForeignAccess.sendExecute(executeNode, function, arguments);        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {            // ... convert errors to guest language errors ...        }    }}Interop 2.0:####abstract static class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments);    @Specialization(guards = &quot;functions.isExecutable(function)&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    Object doDefault(Object function, Object[] arguments,                    @CachedLibrary(&quot;function&quot;) InteropLibrary functions) {        try {            return functions.execute(function, arguments);        } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {            // ... convert errors to guest language errors ...        }    }}Note the following differences:  To invoke messages we call instance methods on TruffleLibrary instead of calling a static method on ForeignAccess.  The old interop required to create one node for each operation. With the new version, only one specialized interop library is created.  In the old API we needed to specialize the receiver type for TruffleObject. The new interop library can be invoked with any interop value. By default isExecutable will return false for values that don’t export the interop library. E.g. it is now valid to call the library with boxed primitive receiver values.  Instead of using @Cached in the old interop, in the new interop we use @CachedLibrary.  The new @CachedLibrary annotation specifies the value the library specializes on. This allows the DSL to specialize the library instance to that value. This again allows the dispatch on the receiver value to be performed once for all message invocations. In the old interop version, the nodes could not be specialized to values. Therefore the dispatch needed to be repeated for every interop message send.  The specialized library instance requires to specify a limit for the specialization method. If this limit overflows the uncached version of the library will be used that does not perform any profiling/caching. The old interop API assumed a constant specialization limit of 8 per interop node.  The new interop API allows using a dispatched version of the library by specifying @CachedLibrary(limit=&quot;2&quot;) instead. This allows the interop library to be used with any value, but it has the disadvantage of duplicating the inline cache for every message invocation, like with the old interop API. It is therefore recommended to use specialized libraries whenever it is possible.Slow-Path Sending Interop MessagesIt is sometimes necessary to call interop messages from the runtime without the context of a node.Interop 1.0:ForeignAccess.sendRead(Message.READ.createNode(), object, &quot;property&quot;)Interop 2.0:####InteropLibrary.getFactory().getUncached().read(object, &quot;property&quot;);Note the following differences:  The old interface allocated a node for each invocation.  The new library uses the uncached version of the library that does not require any allocation or boxing for each invocation.  With InteropLibrary.getFactory().getUncached(object) an uncached and specialized version of a library can be looked up. This can be used to avoid repeated export lookups if multiple uncached interop messages need to be sent to the same receiver.Custom Fast-Path Sending Interop MessagesSometimes Truffle DSL cannot be used and the nodes need to be written manually. Both APIs allow you to do so.Interop 1.0:final class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    @Child private Node isExecutableNode = Message.IS_EXECUTABLE.createNode();    @Child private Node executeNode = Message.EXECUTE.createNode();    Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments) {        if (function instanceof TruffleObject) {            TruffleObject tFunction = (TruffleObject) function;            if (ForeignAccess.sendIsExecutable(isExecutableNode, tFunction)) {                try {                    return ForeignAccess.sendExecute(executeNode, tFunction, arguments);                } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {                    // TODO handle errors                }            }        }        // throw user error    }}Interop 2.0:####static final class ForeignExecuteNode extends Node {    @Child private InteropLibrary functions = InteropLibrary.getFactory().createDispatched(5);    Object execute(Object function, Object[] arguments) {        if (functions.isExecutable(function)) {            try {                return functions.execute(function, arguments);            } catch (UnsupportedTypeException | ArityException | UnsupportedMessageException e) {                // handle errors                return null;            }        }        // throw user error    }}Note the following differences:  The new interop creates nodes through the LibraryFactory&amp;lt;InteropLibrary&amp;gt; accessible through InteropLibrary.getFactory(). The old interop creates dispatching nodes through the Message instance.  The dispatch limit can be specified for the new interop libraries. The old interop API always assumed a constant limit of 8.  For the new interop we do not need to check for the type TruffleObject as Truffle Libraries can be used with any receiver type. For non-function values isExecutable will just return false.Implementing / Exporting Interop MessagesTo implement / export interop library messages see the following example.Interop 1.0:@MessageResolution(receiverType = KeysArray.class)final class KeysArray implements TruffleObject {    private final String[] keys;    KeysArray(String[] keys) {        this.keys = keys;    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;HAS_SIZE&quot;)    abstract static class HasSize extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver) {            return true;        }    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;GET_SIZE&quot;)    abstract static class GetSize extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver) {            return receiver.keys.length;        }    }    @Resolve(message = &quot;READ&quot;)    abstract static class Read extends Node {        public Object access(KeysArray receiver, int index) {            try {                return receiver.keys[index];            } catch (IndexOutOfBoundsException e) {                CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter();                throw UnknownIdentifierException.raise(String.valueOf(index));            }        }    }    @Override    public ForeignAccess getForeignAccess() {        return KeysArrayForeign.ACCESS;    }    static boolean isInstance(TruffleObject array) {        return array instanceof KeysArray;    }}Interop 2.0:####@ExportLibrary(InteropLibrary.class)final class KeysArray implements TruffleObject {    private final String[] keys;    KeysArray(String[] keys) {        this.keys = keys;    }    @ExportMessage    boolean hasArrayElements() {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    boolean isArrayElementReadable(long index) {        return index &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; index &amp;lt; keys.length;    }    @ExportMessage    long getArraySize() {        return keys.length;    }    @ExportMessage    Object readArrayElement(long index) throws InvalidArrayIndexException {        if (!isArrayElementReadable(index) {            throw InvalidArrayIndexException.create(index);        }        return keys[(int) index];    }}Note the following differences:  Instead of @MessageResolution we use @ExportLibrary.  Both versions need to implement TruffleObject. The new interop API only requires a TruffleObject type for compatibility reasons.  Instead of @Resolve the @ExportMessage annotation is used. The latter annotation can infer the name of the message from the method name. If the method name is ambiguous, e.g. when multiple libraries are exported, then the name and library can be specified explicitly.  There is no need to specify classes for exports/resolves. However, it is still possible to do so if an export needs multiple specializations. See the TruffleLibrary tutorial for details.  Exceptions are now thrown as checked exceptions.  It is no longer needed to implement getForeignAccess(). The implementation discovers implementations for receiver types automatically.  It is no longer needed to implement isInstance. The implementation can is now derived from the class signature. Note that the check can be more efficient if the receiver type is declared final. For non-final receiver types, it is recommended to specify exported methods as final.Integration with DynamicObjectThe old interop allowed to specify a foreign access factory through ObjectType.getForeignAccessFactory(). This method is now deprecated and a new method ObjectType.dispatch() was introduced. Instead of a foreign access factory, the dispatch method needs to return a class that exports the InteropLibrary with an explicit receiver.Interop 1.0:public final class SLObjectType extends ObjectType {    public static final ObjectType SINGLETON = new SLObjectType();    private SLObjectType() {    }    public static boolean isInstance(TruffleObject obj) {        return SLContext.isSLObject(obj);    }    @Override    public ForeignAccess getForeignAccessFactory(DynamicObject obj) {        return SLObjectMessageResolutionForeign.ACCESS;    }}@MessageResolution(receiverType = SLObjectType.class)public class SLObjectMessageResolution {    @Resolve(message = &quot;WRITE&quot;)    public abstract static class SLForeignWriteNode extends Node {...}    @Resolve(message = &quot;READ&quot;)    public abstract static class SLForeignReadNode extends Node {...}    ...Interop 2.0:####@ExportLibrary(value = InteropLibrary.class, receiverType = DynamicObject.class)public final class SLObjectType extends ObjectType {    public static final ObjectType SINGLETON = new SLObjectType();    private SLObjectType() {    }    @Override    public Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; dispatch() {        return SLObjectType.class;    }    @ExportMessage    static boolean hasMembers(DynamicObject receiver) {        return true;    }    @ExportMessage    static boolean removeMember(DynamicObject receiver, String member) throws UnknownIdentifierException {...}        ... other exports omitted ... }Note the following differences:  The object type can be reused as the export class.  The isInstance method no longer needs to be specified.  The new interop requires to specify the receiver type to DynamicObject.Extending InteropTruffle languages rarely need to extend interop, but they might need to extend their own language specific protocol.Interop 1.0:  Add new KnownMessage subclass called FooBar.  Add a new method sendFooBar to ForeignAccess.  Add a new method to ForeignAccess.Factory: createFooBar.  Modify the interop annotation processor to generate the code for createFooBar.Interop 2.0:####  Add a new method fooBar in InteropLibrary. Everything else is done automatically.",

                    "title": "Documentation for Native Image User",
                    "content": "Java Native Interface (JNI) on Substrate VM(See also the guide on assisted configuration of JNI and other dynamic features)JNI is a native API that enables Java code to interact with native code and vice versa.This page gives an overview over the JNI implementation in Substrate VM.IntegrationJNI support is enabled by default and built into Substrate VM images. Individual classes, methods, and fields that should be accessible via JNI must be specified during native image generation in a configuration file (read below).LinkingJava code can load native code from a shared object with System.loadLibrary().Alternatively, native code can load the JVM’s native library and attach to its Java environment using JNI’s invocation API.The Substrate VM JNI implementation supports both approaches.ReflectionJNI supports looking up classes by their names, and looking up methods and fields by their names and signatures.This requires keeping the necessary metadata for these lookups around.The image build must know beforehand which items will be looked up in case they might not be reachable otherwise and therefore would not be included in the native image.Moreover, the image build must generate call wrapper code ahead of time for any method that can be called via JNI.Therefore, specifying a concise list of items that need to be accessible via JNI guarantees their availability and allows for a smaller footprint.Such a list can be specified with the following image build argument:-H:JNIConfigurationFiles=/path/to/jniconfigwhere jniconfig is a JSON configuration file.The syntax is the same as for reflection configuration files, which are described in the documentation on reflection.The image build generates JNI reflection metadata for all classes, methods and fields referenced in the configuration file.More than one JNI configuration can be used by specifying multiple paths for JNIConfigurationFiles and separating them with ,.Also, -H:JNIConfigurationResources can be specified to load one or several configuration files from the image build’s class path, such as from a JAR file.Alternatively, a custom Feature implementation can register program elements before and during the analysis phase of the native image build using the JNIRuntimeAccess class.For example:@AutomaticFeatureclass JNIRegistrationFeature implements Feature {  public void beforeAnalysis(BeforeAnalysisAccess access) {    try {      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class);      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;hash&quot;));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredConstructor(char[].class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;charAt&quot;, int.class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;format&quot;, String.class, Object[].class));      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class);      JNIRuntimeAccess.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;compare&quot;, String.class, String.class));    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | NoSuchFieldException e) { ... }  }}Object handlesJNI does not permit direct access to Java objects.Instead, JNI provides word-sized object handles that can be passed to JNI functions to access objects indirectly.Local handles are only valid for the duration of a native call and only in the caller’s thread, while global handles are valid across threads and remain valid until they are destroyed explicitly.The handle 0 represents NULL.Substrate VM implements local handles with a thread-local, growing array of referenced objects, where the index in the array is the handle value.A “finger” points to where the next handle will be allocated.Native calls can be nested, so before a native method is invoked, the call stub pushes the current finger on a stack, and after it returns, it restores the old finger from the stack and nullifies all object references from the call in the array.Global handles are implemented using a variable number of object arrays in which referenced objects are inserted and nullified using atomic operations.A global handle’s value is a negative integer that is determined from the index of the containing array and the index within the array.Therefore, the JNI code can distinguish local and global handles by only looking at their sign.The analysis is not obstructed by object handles because it can observe the entire flow of object references and the handles that are passed to native code are only numeric values.Java-to-native method callsMethods declared with the native keyword have a JNI-compliant implementation in native code, but can be called like any other Java method.For example:// Java declarationnative int[] sort0(int[] array);// native declaration with JNI name manglingjintArray JNICALL Java_org_example_sorter_IntSorter_sort0(JNIEnv *env, jobject this, jintArray array) {When the image build encounters a method that is declared native, it generates a Graal graph with a wrapper that performs the transition to native code and back, adds the JNIEnv* and this arguments, boxes any object arguments in handles and, in case of an object return type, unboxes the returned handle.The actual native call target address can only be determined at runtime.Therefore, the image build also creates an extra linkage object in the reflection metadata of native-declared methods.When a native method is called, the call wrapper looks up the matching symbol in all loaded libraries and stores the resolved address in the linkage object for future calls.Alternatively, instead of requiring symbols that conform to JNI’s name mangling scheme, Substrate VM also supports the RegisterNatives JNI function to explicitly provide code addresses for native methods.JNI FunctionsJNI provides a set of functions that native code can use to interact with Java code.Substrate VM implements these functions using @CEntryPoint, for example:@CEntryPoint(...) private static void DeleteGlobalRef(JNIEnvironment env, JNIObjectHandle globalRef) { /* setup; */ JNIGlobalHandles.singleton().delete(globalRef); }JNI specifies that these functions are provided via function pointers in a C struct that is accessible via the JNIEnv* argument.The automatic initialization of this struct is prepared during the image build.Native-to-Java method callsNative code can invoke Java methods by first obtaining a jmethodID for the target method, and then using one of the Call&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method, CallStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method or CallNonvirtual&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Method functions for the invocation.Each of these Call... functions is also available in a Call...MethodA and a Call...MethodV variant, which take arguments as an array or as a va_list instead of variadic arguments.For example:jmethodID intcomparator_compare_method = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetMethodID(env, intcomparator_class, &quot;compare&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;);jint result = (*env)-&amp;gt;CallIntMethod(env, this, intcomparator_compare_method, a, b);The image build generates call wrappers for each method that can be called via JNI according to the provided JNI configuration.The call wrappers conform to the signature of the JNI Call... functions that are appropriate for the method.The wrappers perform the transition to Java code and back, adapt the argument list to the target Java method’s signature, unbox any passed object handles, and if necessary, box the return type in an object handle.Each method that can be called via JNI has a reflection metadata object.The address of this object is used as the method’s jmethodID.The metadata object contains the addresses of all of the method’s generated call wrappers.Because each call wrapper conforms precisely to the corresponding Call... function signature, the Call... functions themselves are nothing more than an unconditional jump to the appropriate call wrapper based on the passed jmethodID.As another optimization, the call wrappers are able to efficiently restore the current thread’s Java context from the JNIEnv* argument.Object creationJNI provides two ways of creating Java objects, either by calling AllocObject to allocate memory and then using CallVoidMethod to invoke the constructor, or by using NewObject to create and initialize the object in a single step (or variants NewObjectA or NewObjectV).For example:jclass calendarClass = (*env)-&amp;gt;FindClass(env, &quot;java/util/GregorianCalendar&quot;);jmethodID ctor = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetMethodID(env, calendarClass, &quot;&amp;lt;init&amp;gt;&quot;, &quot;(IIIIII)V&quot;);jobject firstObject = (*env)-&amp;gt;AllocObject(env, calendarClass);(*env)-&amp;gt;CallVoidMethod(env, obj, ctor, year, month, dayOfMonth, hourOfDay, minute, second);jobject secondObject = (*env)-&amp;gt;NewObject(env, calendarClass, ctor, year, month, dayOfMonth, hourOfDay, minute, second);Substrate VM supports both approaches.The constructor must be included in the JNI configuration with a method name of &amp;lt;init&amp;gt;.Instead of generating additional call wrappers for NewObject, the regular CallVoidMethod wrapper is reused and detects when it is called via NewObject because it is passed the Class object of the target class.In that case, the call wrapper allocates a new instance before invoking the actual constructor.Field accessesNative code can access a Java field by obtaining its jfieldID and then using one of the Get&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field, Set&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field, GetStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field or SetStatic&amp;lt;Type&amp;gt;Field functions.For example:jfieldID intsorter_comparator_field = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetFieldID(env, intsorter_class, &quot;comparator&quot;, &quot;Lorg/example/sorter/IntComparator;&quot;);jobject value = (*env)-&amp;gt;GetObjectField(env, self, intsorter_comparator_field);For a field that is accessible via JNI, its offset within an object (or within the static field area) is stored in the reflection metadata and is used as its jfieldID.The image build generates accessor methods for for fields of all primitive types and for object fields.These accessor methods perform the transition to Java code and back, and use unsafe loads or stores to directly manipulate the field value.Because the analysis cannot observe assignments of object fields via JNI, it assumes that any subtype of the field’s declared type can occur in a field that is accessible via JNI.JNI also permits writing fields that are declared final, which must be enabled for individual fields with an allowWrite property in the configuration file.However, code accessing final fields might not observe changes of final field values in the same way as for non-final fields because of optimizations.ExceptionsJNI specifies that exceptions in Java code that are the result of a call from native code must be caught and retained.In Substrate VM, this is done in the native-to-Java call wrappers and in the implementation JNI functions.Native code can then query and clear a pending exception with the ExceptionCheck, ExceptionOccurred, ExceptionDescribe and ExceptionClear functions.Native code can also throw exceptions with Throw, ThrowNew or FatalError.When an exception remains unhandled in native code or the native code itself throws an exception, the Java-to-native call wrapper rethrows that exception upon reentering Java code.MonitorsJNI declares the functions MonitorEnter and MonitorExit to acquire and release the intrinsic lock of an object.Substrate VM provides implementations of these functions.However, the native image build directly assigns intrinsic locks only to objects of classes which the analysis can observe as being used in Java synchronized statements and with wait(), notify() and notifyAll().For other objects, synchronization falls back on a slower mechanism which uses a map to store lock associations, which itself needs synchronization.For that reason, it can be beneficial to wrap synchronization in Java code.java.lang.reflect SupportThe JNI functions FromReflectedMethod and ToReflectedMethod can be used to obtain the corresponding jmethodID to a java.lang.reflect.Method, or to a java.lang.reflect.Constructor object, and vice versa.The functions FromReflectedField and ToReflectedField convert between jfieldID and java.lang.reflect.Field.In order to use these functions, reflection support must be enabled and the methods and fields in question must be included in the reflection configuration, which is specified with -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=.",

                    "content": "About Jython CompatibilityFull Jython compatibility is not a goal of this project. One major reason forthis is that most Jython code that uses Java integration will be based on astable Jython release, and these only come in Python 2.x versions. The GraalVMimplementation of Python, in contrast, is only targeting Python 3.x.Nonetheless, there are certain features of Jython’s Java integration that we canoffer similarly. Here is an example:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java.awt as awt&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win = awt.Frame()&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.setSize(200, 200)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.setTitle(&quot;Hello from Python!&quot;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.getSize().toString()&#39;java.awt.Dimension[width=200,height=200]&#39;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; win.show()This example works exactly the same on both Jython and Python on GraalVM. Somefeatures of Jython are more expensive at runtime, and thus are hidden behind acommand line flag on Graal: --python.EmulateJython.ImportingImport statements allow you to import Java classes, but (unlike Jython), onlypackages in the java namespace can be directly imported. So this works:import java.lang as langBut this doesn’t:import javax.swing as swingfrom javax.swing import *Instead, you’ll have to import one of the classes you’re interested in directly:import javax.swing.Window as WindowBasic Object UsageConstructing and working with Java objects and classes is done with naturalPython syntax. The methods of Java objects can also be retrieved and passedaround as first class objects (bound to their instance) the same as Pythonmethods:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from java.util import Random&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rg = Random(99)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; boundNextInt = rg.nextInt&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; rg.nextInt()1491444859&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; boundNextInt = rg.nextInt1672896916Java-to-Python Types: Automatic ConversionMethod overloads are resolved by matching the Python arguments in a best-effortmanner to the available parameter types. This is also when data conversionhappens. The goal here is to make using Java from Python as smooth aspossible. The matching we do here is similar to Jython, but Graal Python uses amore dynamic approach to matching — Python types emulating int orfloat are also converted to the appropriate Java types. This allows, forexample, to use Pandas frames as double[][] or NumPy array elements as int[]when the elements fit into those Java primitive types.            Java type      Python type                  null      None              boolean      bool              byte, short, int, long      int, any object that has an __int__ method              float      float, any object that has a __float__ method              char      str of length 1              java.lang.String      str              byte[]      bytes, bytearray, wrapped Java array, Python list with only the appropriate types              Java arrays      Wrapped Java array or Python list with only the appropriate types              Java objects      Wrapped Java object of the appropriate type              java.lang.Object      Any object      Special Jython ModulesWe do not offer any of the special Jython modules. For example, the jarraymodule on Jython allows construction of primitive Java arrays. This can beachieved as follows on GraalPython:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;)(10)Code that only needs to pass a Java array can also use Python types. However,implicitly this may entail a copy of the array data, which can be deceiving whenusing Java arrays as output parameters:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i = java.io.ByteArrayInputStream(b&quot;foobar&quot;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; buf = [0, 0, 0]&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i.read(buf) # buf is automatically converted to a byte[] array3&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; buf[0, 0, 0] # the converted byte[] array got lost&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jbuf = java.type(&quot;byte[]&quot;)(3)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; i.read(jbuf)3&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; jbuf[98, 97, 122]Exceptions from JavaCatching all kinds of Java exceptions comes with a performance penalty, and isonly enabled with the --python.EmulateJython flag.&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import java&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; v = java.util.Vector()&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; try:...    x = v.elementAt(7)... except java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException as e:...    print(e.getMessage())...7 &amp;gt;= 0Java CollectionsThere is no automatic mapping of the Python syntax for accessing dictionaryelements to the java.util mapping and list classes’ ` get, set, or put`methods. To use these mapping and list clases, you must call the Java methods:&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ht = java.util.Hashtable()&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ht.put(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ht.get(&quot;foo&quot;)&#39;bar&#39;We also do not support Python-style iteration of Java java.util.Enumerable,java.util.Iterator, or java.lang.Iterable. For these, you’ll have to use awhile loop and use the hasNext() and next() (or equivalent) methods.No Inheriting from JavaPython classes cannot inherit from Java classes. A workaround can be to create aflexible subclass in Java, compile it, and use delegation instead. Take thisexample:import java.util.logging.Handler;public class PythonHandler extends Handler {    private final Value pythonDelegate;    public PythonHandler(Value pythonDelegate) {        this.pythonDelegate = pythonDelegate;    }    public void publish(LogRecord record) {        pythonDelegate.invokeMember(&quot;publish&quot;, record);    }    public void flush() {        pythonDelegate.invokeMember(&quot;flush&quot;);    }    public void close() {        pythonDelegate.invokeMember(&quot;close&quot;);    }}Then you can use it like this in Python:from java.util.logging import LogManager, Loggerclass MyHandler():    def publish(self, logRecord): print(&quot;[python]&quot;, logRecord.toString())​    def flush(): pass​    def close(): pass​LogManager.getLogManager().addLogger(Logger(&#39;my.python.logger&#39;, None, MyHandler()))Embedding Python into JavaThe other way to use Jython is to embed it into Java applications. Where above,Graal Python offered some measure of compatibility with existing Jython code, wedo not offer any in this case. Existing code using Jython depends directly onthe Jython package (for example, in the Maven configuration), because the Javacode has references to Jython internal classes such as PythonInterpreter.For Graal Python, no dependency other than on the GraalVMSDK isrequired. There are no APIs particular to Python that are exposed, andeverything is done through the GraalVM API. Important to know is that as long asyour application is executed on a GraalVM with the Python language installed,you can embed Python in your programs.

                    "content": "Java InteroperabilityGraalVM JavaScript is a JavaScript (ECMAScript) language execution runtime.It allows interoperability with Java code.This document describes the features and usage of this JavaScript to Java interoperability feature.For a reference of GraalVM JavaScript’s public API, see JavaScriptCompatibility.md.Migration guides for Rhino and Nashorn are available.Launching GraalVM JavaScriptDepending on how you build GraalVM JavaScript, it is started in different ways.GraalVM CE or EE by default ships with a js and node native launcher.The following examples assume this setup is used.Enabling Java interoperabilityIn GraalVM CE or EE images, the js and node binaries are started in an ahead-of-time compiled native mode by default.In that mode, Java interoperability is not available.To enable Java interoperability, the --jvm option has to be provided to the native launcher.This way, GraalVM JavaScript is executed on a traditional JVM and allows full Java interoperability.ClasspathTo load Java classes you need to have them on the Java classpath.You can specify the classpath with the --vm.classpath=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt; option (or short: --vm.cp=&amp;lt;classpath&amp;gt;).node --jvm --vm.cp=/my/class/pathjs --jvm --vm.cp=/my/class/pathThe method Java.addToClasspath() can be used to programmatically add to the classpath at runtime.Polyglot ContextThe preferred method of launching GraalVM JavaScript with Java interop support instance is via polyglot Context.For that, a new org.graalvm.polyglot.Context is built with the hostAccess option allowing access and a hostClassLookup predicate defining the Java classes you allow access to:Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;).    allowHostAccess(HostAccess.ALL).    allowHostClassLookup(className -&amp;gt; true).  //allows access to all Java classes    build();context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, jsSourceCode);See graalvm.org for more details.ScriptEngine (JSR 223)The org.graalvm.polyglot.Context is the preferred execution method for interoperability with languages and tool of the GraalVM.In addition, GraalVM JavaScript is fully compatible with JSR 223 and supports the ScriptEngine API.Internally, the GraalVM JavaScript ScriptEngine wraps a polyglot context instance.ScriptEngine eng = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;graal.js&quot;);Object fn = eng.eval(&quot;(function() { return this; })&quot;);Invocable inv = (Invocable) eng;Object result = inv.invokeMethod(fn, &quot;call&quot;, fn);Java Interoperability FeaturesRhino, Nashorn and GraalVM JavaScript provide a set of features to allow interoperability from JavaScript to Java.While the overall feature set is mostly comparable, the engines differ in exact syntax, and partly, semantics.Class accessTo access a Java class, GraalVM JavaScript supports the Java.type(typeName) function.var FileClass = Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;);By default, Java classes are not automatically mapped to global variables, e.g., there is no java global property in GraalVM JavaScript.Existing code accessing e.g. java.io.File should be rewritten to use the Java.type(name) function.var FileClass = Java.type(&quot;java.io.File&quot;); //GraalVM JavaScript compliant syntaxvar FileClass = java.io.File;              //FAILS in GraalVM JavaScriptGraalVM JavaScript provides a Packages global property (and java etc. if the js.nashorn-compat option is set) for compatibility.However, explicitly accessing the required class with Java.type should be preferred whenever possible for two reasons:  It allows resolving the class in one step rather than trying to resolve each property as a class.  Java.type immediately throws a TypeError if the class cannot be found or is not accessible rather than silently treating an unresolved name as a package.Constructing Java objectsJava objects can be constructed with JavaScript’s new keyword.var FileClass = Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;);var file = new FileClass(&quot;myFile.md&quot;);Field and method accessStatic fields of a Java class or fields of a Java object can be accessed like JavaScript properties.var JavaPI = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Math&#39;).PI;Java methods can be called like JavaScript functions.var file = new (Java.type(&#39;java.io.File&#39;))(&quot;test.md&quot;);var fileName = file.getName();Conversion of method argumentsJavaScript is defined to operate on the double number type.GraalVM JavaScript might internally use additional Java data types for performance reasons (e.g., the int type).When calling Java methods, a value conversion might be required.This happens when the Java method expects a long parameter, and a int is provided from GraalVM JavaScript (type widening).If this conversion caused a lossy conversion, a TypeError is thrown.//Javavoid longArg   (long arg1);void doubleArg (double arg2);void intArg    (int arg3);//JavaScriptjavaObject.longArg(1);     //widening, OKjavaObject.doubleArg(1);   //widening, OKjavaObject.intArg(1);      //match, OKjavaObject.longArg(1.1);   //lossy conversion, TypeError!javaObject.doubleArg(1.1); //match, OKjavaObject.intArg(1.1);    //lossy conversion, TypeError!Selection of methodJava allows overloading of methods by argument types.When calling from JavaScript to Java, the method with the narrowest available type that the actual argument can be converted to without loss is selected.//Javavoid foo(int arg);void foo(short arg);void foo(double arg);void foo(long arg);//JavaScriptjavaObject.foo(1);              //will call foo(short arg);javaObject.foo(Math.pow(2,16)); //will call foo(int arg);javaObject.foo(1.1);            //will call foo(double arg);javaObject.foo(Math.pow(2,32)); //will call foo(long arg);Note that there currently is no way of overriding this behavior from GraalVM JavaScript.In the example above, one might want to always call foo(int arg), even when foo(short arg) can be reached with lossless conversion (foo(1)).Future versions of GraalVM JavaScript might lift that restriction by providing an explicit way to select the method to be called.Package accessGraalVM JavaScript provides a Packages global property.&amp;gt; Packages.java.io.FileJavaClass[java.io.File]Array accessGraalVM JavaScript supports the creation of Java arrays from JavaScript code.Both the patterns suggested by Rhino and Nashorn are supported://Rhino patternvar JArray = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.reflect.Array&#39;);var JString = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.String&#39;);var sarr = JArray.newInstance(JString, 5);//Nashorn patternvar IntArray = Java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;);var iarr = new IntArray(5);The arrays created are Java types, but can be used in JavaScript code:iarr[0] = iarr[iarr.length] * 2;Map accessIn GraalVM JavaScript you can create and access Java Maps, e.g. java.util.HashMap.var HashMap = Java.type(&#39;java.util.HashMap&#39;);var map = new HashMap();map.put(1, &quot;a&quot;);map.get(1);GraalVM JavaScript supports iterating over such map similar to Nashorn:for (var key in map) {    print(key);    print(map.get(key));}List accessIn GraalVM JavaScript you can create and access Java Lists, e.g. java.util.ArrayList.var ArrayList = Java.type(&#39;java.util.ArrayList&#39;);var list = new ArrayList();list.add(42);list.add(&quot;23&quot;);list.add({});for (var idx in list) {    print(idx);    print(list.get(idx));}String accessGraalVM JavaScript can create Java strings with Java interoperability.The length of the string can be queried with the length property.Note that length is a value property and cannot be called as a function.var javaString = new (Java.type(&#39;java.lang.String&#39;))(&quot;Java&quot;);javaString.length === 4;Note that GraalVM JavaScript uses Java strings internally to represent JavaScript strings, so above code and the JavaScript string literal &quot;Java&quot; are actually not distinguishable.Iterating propertiesProperties (fields and methods) of Java classes and Java objects can be iterated with a JavaScript for..in loop.var m = Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Math&#39;)for (var i in m) { print(i); }&amp;gt; E&amp;gt; PI&amp;gt; abs&amp;gt; sin&amp;gt; ...This is working as in existing Rhino code.Access to JavaScript objects from JavaJavaScript objects are exposed to Java code as instances of com.oracle.truffle.api.interop.java.TruffleMap.This class implements Java’s Map interface.JavaImporterThe JavaImporter feature is available only in Nashorn compatibility mode (js.nashorn-compat option).Console output of Java classes and Java objectsGraalVM JavaScript provides both print and console.log.GraalVM JavaScript provides a print builtin function compatible with Nashorn.The console.log is provided by Node.js directly.It does not provide special treatment of interop objects.Note that the default implementation of console.log on GraalVM JavaScript is just an alias for print, and Node’s implementation is only available when running on Node.js.ExceptionsExceptions thrown in Java code can be caught in JavaScript code.They are represented as Java objects.try {    Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Class&#39;).forName(&quot;nonexistent&quot;);} catch (e) {    print(e.getMessage());}PromisesGraalVM JavaScript provides support for interoperability between JavaScript Promise objects and Java.Java objects can be exposed to JavaScript code as thenable objects, allowing JavaScript code to await Java objects.Moreover, JavaScript Promise objects are regular JavaScript objects, and can be accessed from Java using the mechanisms described in this document.This allows Java code to be called back from JavaScript when a JavaScript promise is resolved or rejected.Creating JavaScript Promise objects that can be resolved from JavaJavaScript applications can create Promise objects delegating to Java the resolution of the Promise instance.This can be achieved from JavaScript by using a Java object as the “executor” function of the JavaScript Promise.For example, Java objects implementing the following functional interface can be used to create new Promise objects:@FunctionalInterfacepublic interface PromiseExecutor {    void onPromiseCreation(Value onResolve, Value onReject);}Any Java object implementing PromiseExecutor can be used to create a JavaScript Promise:// `javaExecutable` is a Java object implementing the `PromiseExecutor` interfacevar myPromise = new Promise(javaExecutable).then(...);JavaScript Promise objects can be created not only using functional interfaces, but also using any other Java object that can be executed by the GraalVM JavaScript engine (for example, any Java object implementing the Polyglot ProxyExecutable interface).More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.Using await with Java ObjectsJavaScript applications can use the await expression with Java objects.This can be useful when Java and JavaScript have to interact with asynchronous events.To expose a Java object to GraalVM JavaScript as a thenable object, the Java object should implement a method called then() having the following signature:void then(Value onResolve, Value onReject);When await is used with a Java object implementing then(), the GraalVM JavaScript runtime will treat the object as a JavaScript Promise.The onResolve and onReject arguments are executable Value objects that should be used by the Java code to resume or abort the JavaScript await expression associated with the corresponding Java object.More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.Using JavaScript Promises from JavaPromise objects created in JavaScript can be exposed to Java code like any other JavaScript object.Java code can access such objects like normal Value objects, with the possibility to register new promise resolution functions using the Promise’s default then() and catch() functions.As an example, the following Java code registers a Java callback to be executed when a JavaScript promise resolves:Value jsPromise = context.eval(ID, &quot;Promise.resolve(42);&quot;);Consumer&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt; javaThen = (value) -&amp;gt; System.out.println(&quot;Resolved from JavaScript: &quot; + value);jsPromise.invokeMember(&quot;then&quot;, javaThen);More detailed example usages are available in the GraalVM JavaScript unit tests.MultithreadingGraalVM JavaScript supports multithreading when used in combination with Java. More details about the GraalVM JavaScript multithreading model can be found in the Multithreading documentation.",

ECMAScript language compliance  Compatibility extensions  GraalVM JavaScript extensionsECMAScript Language ComplianceGraalVM JavaScript implements JavaScript as prescribed in the ECMAScript (ECMA-262) specification.GraalVM JavaScript is fully compatible with the ECMAScript 2019 specification (sometimes referred to as “version 10” or “ES10”).Most features expected to be part of the upcoming ECMAScript 2020 are already implemented and are available behind specific flags.Starting with GraalVM 20.1.0, ECMAScript 2020 features will be enabled by default.Older versions starting from ECMAScript 5 can be enabled with a config flag.It is recommended to use a fixed ECMAScript version in a production environment, with the most recent published ECMAScript 2019 specification being a reasonable target.For informations on the flags, see the –help message of the executable.GraalVM JavaScript provides the following function objects in the global scope as specified by ECMAScript, representing the JavaScript core library:Array, ArrayBuffer, Boolean, DataView, Date, Error, Function, JSON, Map, Math, Number, Object, Promise, Proxy, Reflect, RegExp, Set, SharedArrayBuffer, String, Symbol, TypedArray, WeakMap, WeakSetSome additional objects are available under flags (run js --help for the list of available flags):Atomics, Intl, SIMDSeveral of these function objects and some of their members are only available when a certain version of the spec is selected for execution.For a list of methods provided, inspect the ECMAScript specification.Extensions to the specification are specified below.Internationalization API (ECMA-402)Internationalization API implementation (see https://tc39.github.io/ecma402) can be activated using the following flag: --js.intl-402=true.If you run in native mode (default option), you also need to specify path to your ICU data directory using the following option: --vm.Dcom.ibm.icu.impl.ICUBinary.dataPath=$GRAAL_VM_DIR/jre/languages/js/icu4j/icudt,where $GRAAL_VM_DIR refers to your GraalVM installation directory.If you run in JVM mode (a jvm flag is used), you do not need to specify where your ICU data are located, although you can do it with the mentioned option.Once you activate the Internationalization API, you can use the following built-ins:  Intl.NumberFormat  Intl.DateTimeFormat  Intl.Collator  Intl.PluralRulesFunctionality of a few other built-ins is then also updated according to the specification linked above.JavaScript modulesGraalVM JavaScript supports modules as defined by ECMAScript 6 and later.Be aware that the support for this feature grew and still grows over time, be sure to use the latest ECMAScript version for the all the latest features.When loading modules via a polyglot Source, you can use the inofficial application/javascript+module mime type to specify you are loading a module.When loading with JavaScript code from a file, make sure the module is loaded from a file with the .mjs extension.Loading with the import keyword is not limited by that, you can import from a file of any extension.Compatibility ExtensionsThe following objects and methods are available in GraalVM JavaScript for compatibility with other JavaScript execution engines.Note that the behaviour of such methods might not strictly match the semantics of those methods in all existing engines.Language featuresConditional catch clausesGraalVM JavaScript supports conditional catch clauses if the js.syntax-extensions option is enabled:try {    myMethod(); // can throw} catch (e if e instanceof TypeError) {    print(&quot;TypeError caught&quot;);} catch (e) {    print(&quot;another Error caught&quot;);}Global propertiesload(source)Loads (parses and executes) the specified JavaScript source code.Source can be of type:  a String: the path of the source file or a URL to execute.  java.lang.URL: the URL is queried for the source code to execute if the js.load-from-url option is set to true.  java.io.File: the File is read for the source code to execute.  a JavaScript object: the object is queried for a name and a script property, which represent the source name and code, respectively.  all other types: the source is converted to a String.load is available by default and can be deactivated by setting the js.load option to false.print(...arg) and printErr(...arg)Prints the arguments on the console (stdout and stderr, respectively).Provides a best-effort human readable output.print and printErr are available by default and can be deactivated by setting the js.print option to false.Methods of the console global objectA global console object is provided that offers several methods for debugging purposes.These methods strive to provide similar functionality as provided in other engines, but do not guarantee identical results.Note that those methods behave differently when GraalVM JavaScript is executed in Node.js mode (i.e., the node executable is started instead of js).Node.js provides its own implementation that is used instead.  console.log, console.info, and console.debug: an alias for print(...arg)  console.error, and console.warn: similar to print, but using the error IO stream  console.assert(check, message): prints message when check is falsy  console.clear: clears the console window if possible  console.count(), and console.countReset(): counts and print how many times it has been called, or resets this counter  console.group, and console.groupEnd: increases or decreases the indentation for succeeding outputs to the console  console.time(), console.timeLog(), and console.timeEnd(): starts a timer, prints the duration the timer has been active, or prints the duration and stops the timer, respectivelyThe console object is available by default and can be deactivated by setting the option js.console to false.Additional global functions in the js shellquit(status)Exits the engine and returns the specified status code.read(file)This function reads the content of file.The result is returned as String.The argument file can be of type:  java.io.File: the file is used directly.  all other types: file is converted to a String and interpreted as file name.readbuffer(file)This function reads the content of file similar to the read function.The result is returned as a JavaScript ArrayBuffer object.readline()This function reads one line of input from the input stream.It returns a String as result.ObjectObject.prototype.__defineGetter__(prop, func)Defines the prop property of this to be the getter function func.This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__defineSetter__(prop, func)Defines the prop property of this to be the setter function func.This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__lookupGetter__(prop)Returns the getter function for property prop of the object as set by __defineGetter__.This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Object.prototype.__lookupSetter__(prop)Returns the setter function for property prop of the object as set by __defineSetter__.This functionality is deprecated in most JavaScript engines.In recent ECMAScript versions, getters and setters are natively supported by the language.Nashorn scripting modeGraalVM JavaScript provides a scripting mode compatible to the one provided by the Nashorn engine.It is enabled with the js.scripting option, make also sure to have --experimental-options set:$ js --experimental-options --js.scripting=trueIn scripting mode, several properties and functions are added to the global object, including readFully, readLine, $ARG, $ENV, and $EXEC.GraalVM JavaScript ExtensionsGraalThe Graal object is provided as property of the global object.It provides Graal-specific information.The existence of the property can be used to identify whether the GraalVM JavaScript engine is the current language engine.if (typeof Graal != &#39;undefined&#39;) {    print(Graal.versionJS);    print(Graal.versionGraalVM);    print(Graal.isGraalRuntime);}The Graal object is available in GraalVM JavaScript by default, unless deactivated by an option (js.graal-builtin=false).Graal.versionJSProvides the version number of GraalVM JavaScript.Graal.versionGraalVMProvides the version of the GraalVM, if the current engine is executed on a GraalVM.Graal.isGraalRuntimeProvides whether GraalVM JavaScript is executed on a Graal-enabled runtime.If true, hot code is compiled by the GraalVM Compiler, resulting in high peak performance.If false, GraalVM JavaScript will not be optimized by the GraalVM Compiler, typically resulting in lower performance.JavaThe Java object is only available when the engine is started in JVM mode (--jvm flag).Note that some functions require a Nashorn compatibility mode flag to be set.On the GraalVM, this flag can be set with:$ js --jvm --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compat=trueJava.type(className)The type function loads the specified Java class and provides it as an object.Fields of this object can be read directly from it, and new instances can be created with the JavaScript new keyword.var BigDec = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);var bd = new BigDec(&quot;0.1&quot;);console.log(bd.add(bd).toString());Java.from(javaData)The from function creates a shallow copy of the Java datastructure (Array, List) as a JavaScript array.In many cases, this is not necessary, you can typically use the Java datastructure directly from JavaScript.Java.to(jsData, toType)The to function converts the argument to a Java dataype.The source object jsData is expected to be a JavaScript array, or object with a length property.The target toType can either be a String (e.g. &quot;int[]&quot;) or a type object (e.g., Java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;)).Valid target types are Java arrays.When no target type is provided, Object[] is assumed.var jsArr = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;];var strArrType = Java.type(&quot;java.lang.String[]&quot;);var javaArr = Java.to(jsArr, strArrType);assertEquals(&#39;class [Ljava.lang.String;&#39;, String(javaArr.getClass()));The conversion methods as defined by ECMAScript (e.g., ToString, ToDouble) are executed when a JavaScript value has to be converted to a Java type.Lossy conversion is disallowed and results in a TypeError.Java.isJavaObject(obj)The isJavaObject method returns whether obj is an object of the Java language.It returns false for native JavaScript objects, as well as for objects of other polyglot languages.Java.isType(obj)The isType method returns whether obj is an object of the Java language, representing a Java Class instance.It returns false for all other arguments.Java.typeName(obj)The typeName method returns the Java Class name of obj.obj is expected to represent a Java Class instance, i.e., isType(obj) should return true; otherwise, undefined is returned.Java.isJavaFunction(fn)The isJavaFunction method returns whether fn is an object of the Java language that represents a Java function.It returns false for all other typies, including native JavaScript function, and functions of other polyglot languages.This function requires the Nashorn compatibility mode flag.Java.isScriptObject(obj)The isScriptObject method returns whether obj is an object of the JavaScript language.It returns false for all other types, including objects of Java and other polyglot languages.This function requires the Nashorn compatibility mode flag.Java.isScriptFunction(fn)The isScriptFunction method returns whether fn is a JavaScript function.It returns false for all other types, including Java function, and functions of other polyglot languages.This function requires the Nashorn compatibility mode flag.Java.addToClasspath(location)The addToClasspath method adds the specified location (file name or path name, as String) to Java’s classpath.PolyglotThe functions of the Polyglot object allow to interact with values from other polyglot languages.The Polyglot object is available by default, unless deactivated by setting the js.polyglot-builtin option to false.Polyglot.export(key, value)Exports the JavaScript value under the name key (a string) to the polyglot bindings.function helloWorld() { print(&quot;Hello, JavaScript world&quot;); }Polyglot.export(&quot;helloJSWorld&quot;, helloWorld);If the polyglot bindings already had a value identified by key, it is overwritten with the new value.Throws a TypeError if key is not a string or missing.The value may be any valid Polyglot value.Polyglot.import(key)Imports the value identified by key (a string) from the polyglot bindings and returns it.var rubyHelloWorld = Polyglot.import(&quot;helloRubyWorld&quot;);rubyHelloWorld();If no language has exported a value identified by key, undefined is returned.Throws a TypeError if key is not a string or missing.Polyglot.eval(languageId, sourceCode)Parses and evaluates the sourceCode with the interpreter identified by languageId.The value of sourceCode is expected to be a String (or convertable to one).Returns the evaluation result, depending on the sourceCode and/or the semantics of the language evaluated.var rArray = Polyglot.eval(&#39;R&#39;, &#39;runif(1000)&#39;);Exceptions can occur when an invalid languageId is passed, when the sourceCode cannot be evaluated by the language, or when the executed program throws one.Polyglot.evalFile(languageId, sourceFileName)Parses the file sourceFileName with the interpreter identified by languageId.The value of sourceFileName is expected to be a String (or convertable to one), representing a file reachable by the current path.Returns an executable object, typically a function.var rFunc = Polyglot.evalFile(&#39;R&#39;, &#39;myExample.r&#39;);var result = rFunc();Exceptions can occur when an invalid languageId is passed, when the file identified by sourceFileName cannot be found, or when the language throws an exception during parsing (parse time errors, e.g. syntax errors).Exceptions thrown by the evaluated program are only thrown once the resulting function is evaluated.The Polyglot.evalFile function is available by default when the Polyglot builtin is available, unless deactivated by setting the js.polyglot-evalfile option to false.It is also available when js.debug-builtin is activated.Debugrequires starting the engine with the js.debug-builtin flag.Debug is a GraalVM JavaScript specific function object that provides functionality for debugging JavaScript code and the GraalVM JavaScript compiler.This API might change without notice, do not use for production purposes!Global functionsprintErr(...arg)The method printErr behaves identical to print.The only difference is, that the error stream is used to print to, instead of the default output stream.loadWithNewGlobal(source, arguments)This method behaves similar to load function.Relevant difference is that the code is evaluated in a new global scope (Realm, as defined by ECMAScript).Source can be of type:  java.lang.URL: the URL is queried for the source code to execute.  a JavaScript object: the object is queried for a name and a script property.  all other types: the source is converted to a String.The value of arguments is provided to the loaded code upon execution.",

                    "content": "GraalVM Native Image Compatibility and Optimization GuideGraalVM Native Image uses a different way of executing Java programs than users of the Java HotSpot VM are used to.It distinguishes between image build time and image run time.At image build time, a static analysis finds all methods that are reachable from the entry point of the application.These (and only these) methods are then ahead-of-time compiled into the native image.Because of the different optimization model, Java programs can behave somewhat differently when compiled into a native image.GraalVM Native Image is an optimization that reduces the memory footprint and startup time of an application.This requires a closed-world assumption, where all code is known at image build time, i.e., no new code is loaded at run time. As with most optimizations, not all applications are amenable for that optimization.If an application is not optimizable, then a so-called fallback image is generated that launches the Java HotSpot VM, i.e., requires a JDK for execution.Class Metadata Features (Require Configuration)The following features generally require configuration at image build time in order to use the closed-world optimization.Configuration ensures that the minimum amount of space necessary is used in the native image binary.If one of the following features is used without providing a configuration at image build time, a fallback image is generated.Dynamic Class LoadingAny class to be accessed by name at image run time must be enumerated at image build time.For example, a call to Class.forName(&quot;myClass”) must have myClass in a configuration file.If the configuration file is used, but does not include a class that is requested for dynamic class loading, a ClassNotFoundException will be thrown, as if the class was not found on the class path or was inaccessible.ReflectionThis category includes listing methods and fields of a class; invoking methods and accessing fields reflectively; and using other classes in the package java.lang.reflect.Individual classes, methods, and fields that should be accessible via reflection need to be known ahead-of-time.Native Image tries to resolve these elements through a static analysis that detects calls to the reflection API.Where the analysis fails the program elements reflectively accessed at run time must be specified during native image generation in a configuration file or by using RuntimeReflection from a Feature.For more details, read our documentation on reflection.During native image generation, reflection can be used without restrictions during native image generation, for example in class initializers.Dynamic ProxyThis category includes generating dynamic proxy classes and allocating instances of dynamic proxy classes using the java.lang.reflect.Proxy API. Dynamic class proxies are supported with the closed-world optimization as long as the bytecode is generated ahead-of-time.This means that the list of interfaces that define dynamic proxies needs to be known at image build time.Native Image employs a simple static analysis that intercepts calls to java.lang.reflect.Proxy.newProxyInstance(ClassLoader, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[], InvocationHandler) and java.lang.reflect.Proxy.getProxyClass(ClassLoader, Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]) and tries to determine the list of interfaces automatically.Where the analysis fails the lists of interfaces can be specified in a configuration file.For more details, read our documentation on dynamic proxies.JCA (Java Cryptography Architecture)The JCA security services must be enabled using the option --enable-all-security-services.They require a custom configuration on Native Image since the JCA framework relies on reflection to achieve algorithm extensibility.For more details, read our documentation on security services.JNI (Java Native Interface)Native code may access Java objects, classes, methods and fields by name, in a similar way to using the reflection API in Java code.So, for the same reasons, any Java artifacts accessed by name via JNI must be specified during native image generation in a configuration file.For more details, read our JNI implementation documentation.Alternative: In addition to JNI, GraalVM Native Image provides its own native interface that is much simpler than JNI and with lower overhead.It allows calls between Java and C, and access of C data structures from Java code.However, it does not allow access of Java data structures from C code.For more details, read our JavaDoc of the package org.graalvm.nativeimage.c and its subpackages.Features Incompatible with Closed World OptimizationSome Java features are not yet supported with the closed-world optimization, and if used, lead to a fallback image.invokedynamic Bytecode and Method HandlesUnder the closed-world assumption, all methods that are called and their call sites must be known.invokedynamic and method handles can introduce calls at runtime or change the method that is invoked.Note that invokedynamic use cases generated by javac for, e.g., Java lambda expressions and string concatenation are supported because they do not change called methods at image run time.SerializationJava serialization requires class metadata information in order to function, and could be supported similarly to reflection using configuration at image build time.However, Java serialization has been a persistent source of security vulnerabilities.The Java architects have announced that the existing serialization mechanism will be replaced with a new mechanism avoiding these problems in the near future.Note that this limitation extends to packages that rely on serialization, such as java.rmi.Security ManagerThe Java security manager is no longer recommended as a way to isolate less trusted code from more trusted code in the same process.This is because almost all typical hardware architectures are susceptible to side-channel attacks to access data that is restricted via the security manager.Using separate processes is now recommended for these cases.Features That May Operate Differently in Native ImageGraalVM Native Image implements some Java features in a different way than the Java HotSpot VM.Class InitializersBy default, classes are initialized at image run time.This ensures compatibility, but limits some optimizations.For faster startup and better peak performance, it is desirable to initialize classes at image build time.Class initialization behavior can be adjusted using the options --initialize-at-build-time or --initialize-at-run-time for specific classes and packages or for all classes.See native-image --help for details.Classes of the JDK class libraries are handled for you and do not need special consideration from the user.Native image users should be aware that class initialization at image build time may break specific assumptions in existing code.For example, files loaded in a class initializer may not be in the same place at image build time as at image run time.Also, certain objects such as a file descriptors or running threads must not be stored into a native image binary.If such objects are reachable at image build time, image generation fails with an error.FinalizersThe Java base class java.lang.Object defines the method finalize().It is called by the garbage collector on an object when garbage collection determines that there are no more references to the object.A subclass overrides the finalize() method to dispose of system resources or to perform other cleanup.Finalizers are deprecated since Java 9.They are complicated to implement, and have badly designed semantics.For example, the finalizer can make the object reachable again by storing it in a static field.Therefore, finalizers are not invoked.We recommend replacing finalizers with weak references and reference queues for use in any Java VM.ThreadsSubstrateVM does not implement long-deprecated methods in java.lang.Thread such as Thread.stop().Unsafe Memory AccessFields that are accessed using sun.misc.Unsafe need to be marked as such for the static analysis if classes are initialized at image build time.In most cases, that happens automatically: field offsets stored in static final fields are automatically rewritten from the hosted value (the field offset for the VM that the image generator is running on) to the native image value, and as part of that rewrite the field is marked as Unsafe-accessed.For non-standard patterns, field offsets can be recomputed manually using the annotation RecomputeFieldValue.Debugging and MonitoringJava has some optional specifications that a Java implementation can use for debugging and monitoring Java programs, including JVMTI.They help you monitor the VM at run time for events like compilation for example, which don’t occur in most native images.These interfaces are built on the assumption that Java bytecode is available at run time, which is not the case for native images built with the closed-world optimization.Because native image generates a native binary, users must use native debuggers and monitoring tools (like GDB or VTune) rather than tools targeted for Java.JVMTI and other bytecode-based tools are not supported with native image.",

                    "content": "The LLVM backend for Native ImageNative Image includes an alternative backend which uses the LLVM intermediate representation and the LLVM compiler to produce native executables. To use it, add the -H:CompilerBackend=llvm option to the Native Image invocation.The LLVM backend requires Graal’s LLVM toolchain to be installed (with gu install llvm-toolchain).Code generation options  -H:+SpawnIsolates: Enables isolates, which are disabled by default when using the LLVM backend as they incur a performance penalty.  -H:+BitcodeOptimizations: Enables aggressive optimizations at the LLVM bitcode level. This is experimental and may cause bugs.Debugging options  -H:TempDirectory=: Specifies where the files generated by Native Image will be saved. The LLVM files are saved under SVM-&amp;lt;timestamp&amp;gt;/llvm in this folder.  -H:LLVMMaxFunctionsPerBatch=: Specifies the maximum size of a compilation batch*. Setting it to 1 compiles every function separately, 0 compiles everything as a single batch.  -H:DumpLLVMStackMap=: Specifies a file in which to dump debugging information, including a mapping between compiled functions and the name of the corresponding bitcode file.*About batches: LLVM compilation happens in four phases:  LLVM bitcode files (named f0.bc, f1.bc, etc.) are created for each function.  The bitcode files are linked into batches (named b0.bc, b1.bc, etc.). This phase is skipped when -H:LLVMMaxFunctionsPerBatch=1 is specified.  The batches are optimized (into b0o.bc, b1o.bc, etc.) and then compiled (into b0.o, b1.o, etc.).  The compiled batches are linked into a single object file (llvm.o), which is then linked into the final executable.How to add a target architecture to GraalVM using the LLVM backendAn interesting use case for the LLVM backend is to target a new architecture without having to implement a complete new backend for Native Image. The following are the necessary steps to achieve this at the moment; we are striving to reduce them as much as possible.Target-specific LLVM settingsThere are a few instances where the Graal code has to go deeper than the target-independent nature of LLVM.These are most notably inline assembly snippets to implement direct register accesses and direct register jumps (for trampolines), as well as precisions about the structure of the stack frames of the code emitted by LLVM.All in all, this represents less than a dozen simple values to be set for each new target, and it is our goal that in the future this will be the only addition needed to support a new target.(Complete set of values for AArch64)LLVM statepoint supportWhile the LLVM backend uses mostly common, well-supported features of LLVM, garbage collection support implies the use of statepoint intrinsics, an experimental feature of LLVM.Currently this feature is only supported for x86_64, and we are currently pushing for the inclusion our implementation for AArch64 in the code base.This means that, unless a significant effort is put together by the LLVM community, supporting a new architecture will require the implementation of statepoints in LLVM for the requested target.As most of the statepoint logic is handled at the bitcode level, i.e. at a target-independent stage, this is mostly a matter of emitting the right type of calls to lower the statepoint intrinsics.Our AArch64 implementation of statepoints consists of less than 100 lines of code.(Implementation of statepoints for AArch64)Object file supportThe data section for programs created with the LLVM backend of the Graal compiler is currently emitted independently from the code, which is handled by LLVM.This means that Graal needs an understanding of object file relocations for the target architecture to be able to link the LLVM-compiled code with the Graal-generated data section.Emitting the data section with the code as LLVM bitcode is our next priority for the LLVM backend, so this should not be an issue for future targets.(see ELFMachine$ELFAArch64Relocations for an example)",

                    "content": "Monomorphization Use CasesThis document illustrates through examples how monomorphization can improveperformance of dynamic languages without going into any detail on howmonomorphization is implemented (described in “Splitting”) orhow to leverage monomorphization in your language implementation (described in“Reporting Polymorphism”)Monomorphization in a NutshellTo better illustrate the benefits of monomorphization, let us first consider asmall example written in JavaScript:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function callsAdd() {    add(1, 2);    add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);}var i = 0;while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {    callsAdd();    i++;}As we can see in this example, the add function is called from callsAdd oncewith integer arguments and once with string arguments.  Once add is executedenough times to be compiled its execution profile will show that the +operator has been executed with both integers and strings and thus handlers(i.e. type checks and execution) for both types will be compiled which has aperformance impact. This can be avoided by rewriting the example as follows:function addInt(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function addString(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function callsAdd() {    addInt(1, 2);    addString(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);}i = 0;while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {    callsAdd();    i++;}In this example the add has been duplicated (split) in such a way that eachtype profile is contained in a separate copy of the function (addInt andaddString). The result is that, come compilation time, only a single typeprofile is available for each function avoiding potentially costly type checksin the compiled code.Automating the detection suitable candidates, as well as their duplication,performed at run time is what we call monomorphization. It is, in other words,automated run-time monomorphization of polymorphic nodes through ASTduplication.Example 1 - Monomorphization of argumentsThis example is an extended version of the illustration example from theprevious section. The add function is still the target for monomorphizationand is called from the action function 3 times with 3 sets of differentarguments (numbers, strings and arrays). We execute the action function for 15seconds in order to have enough time for warmup, and afterwards execute it for60 seconds keeping track of how long each execution took, reporting finally theaverage. We execute this code twice: once with and once without monomorphizationenabled, and report the output of these two runs as well as the speedup.function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}var global = 0;function action() {    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 10000; i++) {        global = add(1, 2);        global = add(&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;);        global = add([1,2,3], [4,5,6]);    }}// Warm up.var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 15000 /* 15 seconds */) {    action();}// Benchmarkvar iterations = 0;var sum = 0;var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 60000 /* 60 seconds */) {    var thisIterationStart = Date.now();    action();    var thisIterationTime = Date.now() - thisIterationStart;    iterations++;    sum += thisIterationTime;}console.log(sum / iterations);Output without monomorphization: 4.494225288735564Output with monomorphization: 4.2421633923Speedup: ~5%Example 2 - Monomorphization of indirect callsThis example is slightly more complicated and illustrates how monomorphizationbenefits higher order functions. In the example, we define the insertionSortfunction, which - given an array of items and a function for comparing theseitems - sorts the array using insertion sort. We define an array of 1000 randomdouble values between 0 and 1 and sort it four times using 4 different sortingmethods (in the action function). Finally, as with the previous example, wewarm up the action function for 15 second, and report the average executiontime of this function over the next 60 seconds with and withoutmonomorphization.function insertionSort (items, comparator) {    for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; items.length; i++) {        let value = items[i];        for (var j = i - 1; j &amp;gt;= 0 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; comparator(items[j], value); j--) {            items[j + 1] = items[j]        }        items[j + 1] = value    }}// Random values in an arrayvar array = new Array(1000);for (i = 0; i &amp;lt; array.length; i++) {    array[i] = Math.random();}function action() {    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a &amp;lt; b                                      });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a &amp;gt; b                                      });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a.toString().length &amp;lt; b.toString().length; });    insertionSort(array, function (a, b) { return a.toString().length &amp;gt; b.toString().length; });}// Warm up.var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 15000 /* 15 seconds */) {    action();}// Benchmarkvar iterations = 0;var sum = 0;var start = Date.now();while ((Date.now() - start) &amp;lt; 60000 /* 60 seconds */) {    var thisIterationStart = Date.now();    action();    var thisIterationTime = Date.now() - thisIterationStart;    iterations++;    sum += thisIterationTime;}console.log(sum / iterations);Output without monomorphization: 194.05161290322582Output with monomorphization: 175.41071428571428Speedup: ~10%",

Concurrent access to JavaScript objects is not allowed: any JavaScript object cannot be accessed by more than one thread at a time.  Concurrent access to Java objects is allowed: any Java object can be accessed by any Java or JavaScript thread, concurrently.A JavaScript Context cannot be accessed by two or more threads, concurrently.It is however possible to access a same Context from multiple threads using proper syncronization, to ensure that concurrent access never happens.ExamplesThe GraalVM JavaScript unit tests contain several examples of multi-threaded Java/JavaScript interactions.The most notable ones describe how:  Multiple Context objects can be executed in multiple threads.  JavaScript values created by one thread can be used from another thread when proper synchronization is used.  A Context can be accessed from multiple threads when proper synchronization is used.  Java concurrency can be used from JavaScript.  Java objects can be accessed by multiple JavaScript threads, concurrently.Multithreading with Node.jsThe basic multi-threading model of GraalVM JavaScript applies to Node.js applications as well.In Node.js, a Worker thread can be created to execute JavaScript code in parallel, but JavaScript objects cannot be shared between workers.On the contrary, a Java object created with GraalVM Java interoperability (e.g., using Java.type()) can be shared between Node.js workers.This allows multi-threaded Node.js applications to share Java objects.ExamplesThe GraalVM Node.js unit tests contain several examples of multi-threaded Node.js applications.The most notable examples show how:  Node.js worker threads can execute Java code.  Java objects can be shared between Node.js worker threads.  JavaScript Promise objects can be used to await on messages from workers, using Java objects to bind promises to worker messages",

                    "content": "The Truffle Native Function InterfaceTruffle includes a way to call native functions, called the Native FunctionInterface, or NFI. It’s implemented as an internal Truffle language thatlanguage implementors can access via the standard polyglot eval interface andTruffle interop. NFI is intended to be used for example to implement alanguage’s FFI, or to call native runtime routines that aren’t available inJava.NFI uses libffi. On a standard JVM it calls it using JNI, and on the GraalVMNative Image it uses System Java. In the future it may be optimised by theGraalVM Compiler in native images so that native calls are made directly fromcompiled code.StabilityThe NFI is an internal language designed for language implementors. It is notconsidered stable and the interface and beavhiour may change without warning.It is not intended to be used directly by end-users.Basic conceptsThe NFI is accessed via the polyglot interface of whatever language you areusing. This could be Java, or could be a Truffle language. This lets you usethe NFI from both your Java language implementation code, or from your guestlanguage to reduce the ammount of Java that you need to write.The entry point is the polyglot eval interface. This runs a special DSL, andreturns Truffle interop objects which can then expose more methods.We’ll write examples using Ruby’s polyglot interface, but any other JVM orTruffle language could be used instead.Basic exampleHere’s a full basic working example, before we go into the details:library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load &quot;libSDL2.dylib&quot;&#39;)  # load a librarysymbol = library[&#39;SDL_GetRevisionNumber&#39;]               # load a symbol from the lirbaryfunction = symbol.bind(&#39;():UINT32&#39;)                     # bind the symbol to types to create a functionputs function.call # =&amp;gt; 12373                           # call the functionLoading libariesTo load a library, we eval a script written in the ‘nfi’ language DSL. Itreturns an object that represents the loaded library.library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;...load command...&#39;)The load command can be any of these forms:  default  load &quot;filename&quot;  load (flag | flag | ...) &quot;filename&quot;default returns a pseudo-library that contains all symbols already loaded inthe process, equivalent to RTLD_DEFAULT in the Posix interface.load &quot;filename&quot; loads a library from a file. You are responsible for anycross-platform concerns about library naming conventions and load paths.load (flag | flag | ...) &quot;filename&quot; allows you to specify flags to load thelibrary. For the default backend (backends will be described later), andwhen running on a Posix platform, the flags available are RTLD_GLOBAL,RTLD_LOCAL, RTLD_LAZY, and RTLD_NOW, which have the conventional Posixsemantics. The default is RTLD_NOW if neither RTLD_LAZY nor RTLD_NOWwere specified.Loading symbols from librariesTo load a symbol from a library, we read the symbol as a property from thelibrary object we previously loaded.symbol = library[&#39;symbol_name&#39;]Producing native function objects from symbolsTo get an executable object that we can call in order to call the nativefunction, we bind the symbol object that we previously loaded, by callingthe bind method on it. We supply a type signature that needs to match thenative function’s actual type signature.function = symbol.bind(&#39;...signature...&#39;)The format of the signature is (arg, arg, ...) : return, where arg andreturn are types.Types can be one of the simple types:  VOID  UINT8  SINT8  UINT16  SINT16  UINT32  SINT32  UINT64  SINT64  FLOAT  DOUBLE  POINTER  STRING  OBJECT  ENVArray types are formed by placing another type in square brackets. For example[UINT8]. These are C-style arrays.Function pointer types are formed by writing a nested signature. For examplethe signature of qsort would be(POINTER, UINT64, UINT64, (POINTER, POINTER) : SINT32) : VOID.For a function with a signature with variadic arguments, you specify ...where the variadic arguments start, but then you must specify the actual typesthat you will be calling the function with. You may therefore need to bind thesame symbol multiple times in order to call it with different types or adifferent number of arguments. For example to call printf with %d %f youwould use the type signature (STRING, ...SINT32, DOUBLE) : SINT32.Type expressions can be nested arbitrarily deep.Two additional special types ENV and OBJECT are described in the sectionon the native API, later in this document.Types can be written in any case.You are responsible for any mapping of types from a foreign language such as Cinto NFI types.Calling native function objectsTo call a native function, we execute it.return_value = function.call(...arguments...)Calling back from native code to managed functionsUsing nested signatures, a function call can get function pointers as arguments.The managed caller needs to pass a Polyglot executable object, that will beconverted to a native function pointer. When calling this function pointer fromthe native side, the execute message is sent to the Polyglot object.void native_function(int32_t (*fn)(int32_t)) {  printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, fn(15));}native_function = library[&#39;native_function&#39;].bind(&quot;((SINT32):SINT32):VOID&quot;)native_function.call(-&amp;gt;(x) { x + 1 })The arguments and return values of callback functions are converted the same asfor regular function calls, with the conversion in the other direction, i.e.arguments are converted from native to managed, and return values are convertedfrom managed to native.Callback function pointers can themselves have function pointer arguments. Thatworks as you would expect: The function accepts a native function pointer asargument, and it is converted to a Truffle executable object. Sending theexecute message to that object calls the native function pointer, same ascalling a regular NFI function.Function pointer types are also supported as return types.Combined loading and bindingYou can optionally combine loading a library with loading symbols and bindingthem. This is achieved with an extended load command, which then returns anobject with the already bound functions as methods.These two examples are equivalent:library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load libSDL2.dylib&#39;)symbol = library[&#39;SDL_GetRevisionNumber&#39;] function = symbol.bind(&#39;():UINT32&#39;)puts function.call # =&amp;gt; 12373library = Polyglot.eval(&#39;nfi&#39;, &#39;load libSDL2.dylib { SDL_GetRevisionNumber():UINT32; }&#39;)puts library.SDL_GetRevisionNumber # =&amp;gt; 12373The definitions in the curly braces {} can contain multiple functionbindings, so that many functions can be loaded from a library at once.BackendsThe load command can be prefixed by with in order to select a specific NFIbackend. Muliple NFI backends are available. The default is called native,and will be used if there is no with prefix, or the selected backend is notavailable.Depending on the configuration of components you are running, availablebackends may include:  native  llvm, which uses the GraalVM LLVM runtime to run the ‘native’ codeNative APIThe NFI can be used with unmodified, already compiled native code, but it canalso be used with a Truffle specific API being used by the native code.The special type ENV adds an additional parameter TruffleEnv *env to thesignature. An additional simple type OBJECT translates to an opaqueTruffleObject type.trufflenfi.h provides declarations for working with these types, that canthen be used by the native code called through the NFI. See trufflenfi.hitself for more documentation on this API.Type marshallingThis section describes in detail how argument values and return values areconverted for all types in the function signature.The following table shows the possible types in NFI signatures with theircorresponding C language types on the native side, and what polyglot valuesthese arguments map to on the managed side:            NFI type      C language type      Polyglot value                  VOID      void      Polyglot object with isNull == true (only valid as return type).              SINT8/16/32/64      int8/16/32/64_t      Polyglot isNumber that fitsIn... the corresponding integer type.              UINT8/16/32/64      uint8/16/32/64_t      Polyglot isNumber that fitsIn... the corresponding integer type.              FLOAT      float      Polyglot isNumber that fitsInFloat.              DOUBLE      double      Polyglot isNumber that fitsInDouble.              POINTER      void *      Polyglot object with isPointer == true or isNull == true.              STRING      char * (zero-terminated UTF-8 string)      Polyglot isString.              OBJECT      TruffleObject      Arbitrary object.              [type]      type * (array of primitive)      Java host primitive array.              (args):ret      ret (*)(args) (function pointer type)      Polyglot function with isExecutable == true.              ENV      TruffleEnv *      nothing (injected argument)      The following sections describe the type conversions in detail.The type conversion behavior with function pointers can be slightly confusing,because the direction of the arguments is reversed. When in doubt, always try tofigure out in which direction arguments or return values flow, from managed tonative or from native to managed.VOIDThis type is only allowed as return type, and is used to denote functions thatdo not return a value.Since in the Polyglot API, all executable objects have to return a value, aPolyglot object with isNull == true will be returned from native functionsthat have a VOID return type.The return value of managed callback functions with return type VOID willbe ignored.Primitive numbersThe primitive number types are converted as you might expect. The argument needsto be a Polyglot number, and its value needs to fit in the value range of thespecified numeric type.One thing to note is the handling of the unsigned integer types. Even though thePolyglot API does not specify separate messages for values fitting in unsignedtypes, the conversion is still using the unsigned value ranges. For example, thevalue 0xFF passed from native to managed through a return value of type SINT8will result in a Polyglot number -1, which fitsInByte, but the same valuereturned as UINT8 results in a Polyglot number 255, which does notfitsInByte. Also, passing -1 to an argument of type UINT8 is atype error, but passing 255 is allowed, even though it does not fitsInByte.Since in the current Polyglot API it is not possible to represent numbersoutside of the signed 64-bit range, the UINT64 type is currently handled withsigned semantics. This is a known bug in the API, and will change in a futurerelease.POINTERThis type is a generic pointer argument. On the native side, it does not matterwhat exact pointer type the argument is.Polyglot object passed to POINTER arguments will be converted to a nativepointer if possible (using the isPointer, asPointer and toNative messagesas necessary). Objects with isNull == true will be passed as a native NULL.POINTER return values will produce a Polyglot object with isPointer == true.The native NULL pointer will additionally have isNull == true.In addition, the returned pointer object will also have a method bind, andbehaves the same as symbols loaded from an NFI library. When calling bind onsuch a pointer, it is the user’s responsibility that to ensure that the pointerreally points to a function with a matching signature.STRINGThis is a pointer type with special conversion semantics for strings.Polyglot strings passed from managed to native using the STRING type will beconverted to a zero-terminated UTF-8 encoded string. For STRING arguments, thepointer is owned by the caller, and is guaranteed to stay alive for the durationof the call only. STRING values returned from managed function pointers to anative caller are also owned by the caller. They have to be freed with freeafter use.Polyglot pointer values or null values can also be passed to STRING arguments.The semantics is the same as for POINTER arguments. The user is responsiblefor ensuring that the pointer is a valid UTF-8 string.STRING values passed from native functions to managed code behave likePOINTER return values, but in addition they have isString == true. The useris responsible for the ownership of the pointer, it might be necessary to freethe return value, depending on the semantics of the called native function.After freeing the returned pointer, the returned polyglot string is invalid andreading it results in undefined behavior. In that sense, the returned Polyglotstring is not a safe object, similar to a raw pointer. It is recommented thatthe user of the NFI copies the returned string before passing it along tountrusted managed code.OBJECTThis argument corresponds to the C type TruffleObject. This type is definedin trufflenfi.h, and is an opaque pointer type. A value of typeTruffleObject represents a reference to an arbitrary managed object.Native code can do nothing with values of type TruffleObject except passingthem back to managed code, either through return values or passing them tocallback function pointers.The lifetime of TruffleObject references needs to be managed manually. See thedocumentation in trufflenfi.h for API functions to manage the lifetime ofTruffleObject references.A TruffleObject passed as argument is owned by the caller, and guaranteed tostay alive for the duration of the call. A TruffleObject reference returnedfrom a callback function pointer is owned by the caller, and needs to be freedafter use. Returning a TruffleObject from a native function does nottransfer ownership (but there is an API function in trufflenfi.h to do that).[...] (native primitive arrays)This type is only allowed as an argument from managed code to a native function,and only arrays of primitive numeric types are supported.On the managed side, only Java host objects containing a Java primitive arrayare supported. On the native side, the type is a pointer to the contents of thearray. It is the user’s responsibility to pass along the array length as aseparate argument.The pointer is valid for the duration of the native call only.Modifications to the contents are propagated back to the Java array afterreturning from the call. The effects of concurrent access to the Java arrayduring the native call are unspecified.(...):... (function pointer)On the native side, a nested signature type corresponds to a function pointerwith the given signature, calling back to managed code.Polyglot executable objects passed from managed to native using a functionpointer type be converted to a function pointer that can be called by the nativecode. For function pointer arguments, the function pointer is owned by thecaller, and is guaranteed to stay alive for the duration of the call only.Function pointers return values are owned by the caller, and have to be freedmanually. See polyglot.h for API functions to managed the lifetime of functionpointer values.Polyglot pointer values or null values can also be passed to function pointerarguments. The semantics is the same as for POINTER arguments. The user isresponsible for ensuring that the pointer is a valid function pointer.Function pointer return types are the same as regular POINTER return types,but in addition they are already bound to the given signature type. Theysupport the execute message, and behave the same as regular NFI functions.ENVThis type is a special argument of type TruffleEnv *. It is only valid asargument type, not as a return type. It is an injected argument on the nativeside, there is no corresponding argument on the managed side.When used as argument type of a native function, the native function will getan environment pointer on this position. That environment pointer can be usedto call API functions (see trufflenfi.h). The argument is injected, forexample, if the signature is (SINT32, ENV, SINT32):VOID, this function objectis expected to be called with two integer arguments, and the correspondingnative function will be called with three arguments, first the first realargument, then the injected ENV argument, and then the second real argument.When the ENV type is used as argument type for a function pointer parameter,that function pointer must be called with a valid NFI environment as argument.If the caller already has an environment, threading it through to callbackfunction pointers is more efficient than calling them without an ENV argument.Other pointsNative functions must use the system’s standard ABI.",

                    "content": "Migration Guide from Nashorn to GraalVM JavaScriptThe the Nashorn engine has been deprecated in JDK 11 as part of JEP 335 and is scheduled to be removed from future JDK releases as part of JEP 372.GraalVM JavaScript can step in as a replacement for code previously executed on the Nashorn engine.It provides all the features previously provided by Nashorn, with many being available by default, some behind flags, some requiring minor modifications to your source code.This document serves as migration guide for code previously targeted to the Nashorn engine.See the JavaInterop.md for an overview of supported Java interoperability features.Both Nashorn and GraalVM JavaScript support a similar set of syntax and semantics for Java interoperability.One notable difference is that GraalVM JavaScript takes a secure by default approach, meaning some features need to be explicitly enabled that were available by default on Nashorn.The most important differences relevant for migration are listed here.Nashorn features available by default (dependent on security settings):  Java.type, Java.typeName  Java.from, Java.to  Java.extend, Java.super  Java package globals: Packages, java, javafx, javax, com, org, eduNashorn Compatibility ModeGraalVM JavaScript provides a Nashorn compatibility mode.Some of the functionality necessary for Nashorn compatibility is only available when the js.nashorn-compat option is enabled.This is the case for Nashorn-specific extensions that GraalVM JavaScript does not want to expose by default.Note that you have to enable experimental options to use this flag.Further note that setting this flag defeats the secure by default approach of GraalVM JavaScript in some cases, e.g. when operating on a legacy ScriptEngine.The js.nashorn-compat option can be set using a command line option:$ js --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compat=trueOr using the polyglot API:import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowExperimentalOptions(true).option(&quot;js.nashorn-compat&quot;, &quot;true&quot;).build()) {    context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(__LINE__)&quot;);}Or using a system property when starting a Java application (remember to enable allowExperimentalOptions on the Context.Builder in your application as well):$ java -Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true MyApplicationFunctionality only available under this flag includes:  Java.isJavaFunction, Java.isJavaMethod, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isScriptFunction  new Interface|AbstractClass(fn|obj)  JavaImporter  JSAdapter  java.lang.String methods on string values  load(&quot;nashorn:parser.js&quot;), load(&quot;nashorn:mozilla_compat.js&quot;)  exit, quitNashorn Syntax ExtensionsNashorn syntax extensions can be enabled using the js.syntax-extensions experimental option.They’re also enabled by default in Nashorn compatibility mode (js.nashorn-compat).Intentional design differencesGraalVM JavaScript differs from Nashorn in some aspects that were intentional design decisions.Secure by defaultGraalVM JavaScript takes a secure by default approach.Unless explicitly permitted by the embedder, JavaScript code cannot access Java classes or access the file system, among other restrictions.Several features of GraalVM JavaScript, including Nashorn compatibility features, are only available when the relevant security settings are permissive enough.Make sure you understand the security implications to your application and the host system of any change that lifts the secure default limits!For a full list of available settings, see the JavaDoc of Context.Builder.Those flags can be defined when building the context with GraalVM’s polyglot API.Flags frequently required to enable features of GraalVM JavaScript are:  allowHostAccess(): Configures which public constructors, methods or fields of public classes are accessible by guest applications. Use HostAccess.EXPLICIT or a custom HostAccess policy to selectively enable access. Set to HostAccess.ALL to allow unrestricted access.  allowHostClassLookup(): Sets a filter that specifies the Java host classes that can be looked up by the guest application. Set to the Predicate className -&amp;gt; true to allow lookup of all classes.  allowIO(): Allows the guest language to perform unrestricted IO operations on host system, required e.g. to load() from the file system. Set to true to enable IO.If you run code on the legacy ScriptEngine, see Setting options via Bindings how to set them there.Finally, note that the nashorn-compat mode enables the relevant flags when executing code on the ScriptEngine (but not on Context), to provide better compatibilty with Nashorn in that setup.Launcher name jsWhen shipped with GraalVM, GraalVM JavaScript comes with a binary launcher named js.Note that, depending on the build setup, GraalVM might still ship Nashorn and its jjs launcher.ScriptEngine name graal.jsGraalVM JavaScript is shipped with ScriptEngine support.It registers under several names, including “graal.js”, “JavaScript”, “js”.Be sure to activate the Nashorn compatibility mode as described above if you need full Nashorn compatibility.Depending on the build setup, GraalVM might still ship Nashorn and provide it via ScriptEngine.For more details, see ScriptEngine.md.ClassFilterGraalVM JavaScript supports a class filter when starting with a polyglot Context.See the JavaDoc of Context.Builder.hostClassFilterFully qualified namesGraalVM Javascript requires the use of Java.type(typename).It does not support accessing classes just by their fully qualified class name by default.Java.type brings more clarity and avoids the accidental use of Java classes in JavaScript code.Patterns like this:var bd = new java.math.BigDecimal(&#39;10&#39;);should be expressed as:var BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);var bd = new BigDecimal(&#39;10&#39;);Lossy conversionGraalVM JavaScript does not allow lossy conversions of arguments when calling Java methods.This could lead to bugs with numeric values that are hard to detect.GraalVM JavaScript will always select the overloaded method with the narrowest possible argument types that can be converted to without loss.If no such overloaded method is available, GraalVM JavaScript throws a TypeError instead of lossy conversion.In general, this affects which overloaded method is executed.Custom targetTypeMappings can be used to customize behavior, see HostAccess.Builder#targetTypeMapping.ScriptObjectMirror objectsGraalVM JavaScript does not provide objects of the class ScriptObjectMirror.Instead, JavaScript objects are exposed to Java code as objects implementing Java’s Map interface.Code referencing ScriptObjectMirror instances can be rewritten by changing the type to either an interface (Map, List) or the polyglot Value class which provides similar capabilities.MultithreadingGraalVM JavaScript supports multithreading by creating several Context objects from Java code.Contexts can be shared between threads, but each context must be accessed by a single thread at a time.Multiple JavaScript engines can be created from a Java application, and can be safely executed in parallel on multiple threads.Context polyglot = Context.create();Value array = polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;);GraalVM JavaScript does not allow the creation of threads from JavaScript applications with access to the current Context.Moreover, GraalVM JavaScript does not allow concurrent threads to access the same Context at the same time.This could lead to unmanagable synchronization problems like data races in a language that is not prepared for multithreading.new Thread(function() {    print(&#39;printed from another thread&#39;); // throws Exception due to potential synchronization problems}).start();JavaScript code can create and start threads with Runnables implemented in Java.The child thread may not access the Context of the parent thread or of any other polyglot thread.In case of violations, an IllegalStateException will be thrown.A child thread may create a new Context instance, though.new Thread(aJavaRunnable).start(); // allowed on GraalVM JavaScriptWith proper synchronization in place, multiple contexts can be shared between different threads. Example Java applications using GraalVM JavaScript Contexts from multiple threads can be found here.Extensions Only Available in Nashorn Compatibility ModeThe following extensions to JavaScript available in Nashorn are deactivated in GraalVM JavaScript by default.They are provided in GraalVM’s Nashorn compatibility mode.It is highly recommended not to implement new applications based on those features, but only to use it as a means to migrate existing applications to GraalVM.String length propertyGraalVM JavaScript does not treat the length property of a String specially.The canonical way of accessing the String length is reading the length property.myJavaString.length;Nashorn allows to both access length as a property and a function.Existing function calls length() should be expressed as property access.Nashorn behavior is mimicked in the Nashorn compatibility mode.Java packages in the JavaScript global objectGraalVM JavaScript requires the use of Java.type instead of fully qualified names.In Nashorn compatibility mode, the following Java package are added to the JavaScript global object: java, javafx, javax, com, org, edu.JavaImporterThe JavaImporter feature is available only in Nashorn compatibility mode.JSAdapterUse of the non-standard JSAdapter is discouraged and should be replaced with the equivalent standard Proxy feature.For compatibility, JSAdapter is still available in Nashorn compatibility mode.Java.* methodsSeveral methods provided by Nashorn on the Java global object are available only in Nashorn compatibility mode or currently not supported by GraalVM JavaScript.Available in Nashorn compatibility mode are: Java.isJavaFunction, Java.isJavaMethod, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isScriptFunction.Currently not supported: Java.asJSONCompatible.AccessorsIn Nashorn compatibility mode, GraalVM JavaScript allows to access getters and setters just by the name as properties, while omitting get, set, or is.var Date = Java.type(&#39;java.util.Date&#39;);var date = new Date();var myYear = date.year; // calls date.getYear()date.year = myYear + 1; // calls date.setYear(myYear + 1);GraalVM JavaScript defines an ordering in which it searches for the field or getters.It will always first try to read or write the field with the name as provided in the property.If the field cannot be read or written, it will try to call a getter or setter:  In case of a read operation, GraalVM JavaScript will first try to call a getter with the name get and the property name in camel case. If that is not available, a getter with the name is and the property name in camel case is called. In the second case, the value is returned even if it is not of type boolean.  In case of a write operation, GraalVM JavaScript will try to call a setter with the name set and the property name in camel case, providing the value as argument to that function.Nashorn can expose random behavior when both getFieldName and isFieldName are available.Nashorn also gives precedence to getters, even when a public field of the exact name is available.Additional Aspects to ConsiderFeatures of GraalVM JavaScriptGraalVM JavaScript supports features of the newest ECMAScript specification and some extensions to that, see JavaScriptCompatibility.md.Note that this e.g. adds objects to the global scope that might interfere with existing source code unaware of those extensions.Console outputGraalVM JavaScript provides a print builtin function compatible with Nashorn.Note that GraalVM JavaScript also provides a console.log function.This is an alias for print in pure JavaScript mode, but uses an implementation provided by Node.js when running in Node mode.Behavior around Java objects differs for console.log in Node mode as Node.js does not implement special treatment for such objects.",

                    "content": "Differences Between Node.js and Java EmbeddingsGraalVM’s JavaScript engine is a fully-compliant ECMA2020 language runtime.As such, it can run JavaScript code in a variety of embedding scenarios, including the Oracle RDBMS, any Java-based application, and Node.js.Depending on the GraalVM’s JavaScript embedding scenario, applications have access to different built-in capabilities.For example, Node.js applications running on GraalVM’s JavaScript engine have access to all of Node.js’ APIs, including built-in Node.js’ modules such as &#39;fs&#39;, &#39;http&#39;, etc.Conversely, JavaScript code embedded in a Java application has access to limited capabilities, as specified through the Context API, and do not have access to Node.js’ built-in modules.In this document we focus on the main differences between a Node.js application and a GraalVM JavaScript application embedded in Java.Context CreationJavaScript code in GraalVM can be executed using a GraalVM execution Context.In a Java application, a new context can be created using the Context API.New contexts can be configured in multiple ways, and configuration options include exposing access to Java classes, allowing access to IO, etc.A list of context creation options can be found in the API documentation.In this scenario, Java classes can be exposed to JavaScript by using GraalVM’s polyglot Bindings.In a Node.js application, the GraalVM Context executing the application is pre-initialized by the Node.js runtime, and cannot be configured by the user application.In this scenario, Java classes can be exposed to the Node.js application by using the --vm.cp= command line option of the bin/node command, as described below.Java InteroperabilityJavaScript applications can interact with Java classes using the Java built-in object.The object is not available by default, and can be enabled in the following way:  In Node.js, start GraalVM using the bin/node --jvm command  In Java, create a GraalVM context using the withHostInterop() option, e.g.:    Context.create(&quot;js&quot;).withHostInterop()    More details on the Java interoperability capabilities of GraalVM JavaScript are available in docs/user/JavaInterop.md.  MultithreadingA GraalVM context running JavaScript enforces a “share-nothing” model of parallelism: no JavaScript values can be accessed by two concurrent Java threads at the same time.In order to leverage parallel execution, multiple contexts have to be created and executed from multiple threads.  In Node.js, multiple contexts can be created using Node.js’ Worker threads API.The worker threads API ensures that no sharing can happen between two parallel contexts.  In Java, multiple contexts can be executed from multiple threads.As long as a context is not accessed by two threads at the same time, parallel execution happens safely.More details on parallel execution in GraalVM JavaScript are available in this blog post.Java LibrariesJava libraries can be accessed from JavaScript in GraalVM through the Java built-in object.In order for a Java library to be accessible from a Context, its jar files need to be added to the GraalVM class path.This can be done in the following way:  In Node.js, the classpath can be modified using the --jvm.cp option.  In Java, the default Java’s -cp option can be used.More details on GraalVM command line options are available in docs/user/Options.md.JavaScript ModulesMany popular JavaScript modules such as those available on the npm package registry can be used from Node.js as well as from Java.GraalVM JavaScript is compatible with the latest ECMA standard, and supports ECMAScript modules (ECM).CommonJS (CJS) modules are supported when running with Node.js.CommonJS modules cannot be used directly from Java; to this end, any popular package bundlers (such as Parcel, Browserify or Webpack) can be used.ECMAScript Modules (ECM)ECMAScript modules can be loaded in GraalVM JavaScript in the following ways:  The support of ECMAScript modules in Node.js is still experimental.GraalVM  supports all features supported by the Node.js version that is compatible with GraalVM.To check such version, simply run bin/node --version.  ECMAScript modules can be loaded in a Context simply by evaluating the module sources.Currently, GraalVM JavaScript loads ECMAScript modules based on their file extension.Therefore, any ECMAScript module must have file name extension .mjs.This might change in future versions of GraalVM JavaScript.More details about evaluating files using the Context API are available in the API Javadoc.CommonJS Modules (CJS)CommonJS modules can be loaded in GraalVM JavaScript in the following way:  In Node.js, modules can be loaded using the require() built-in function, as expected.  By default, the Context API does not support CommonJS modules, and has no built-in require() function.In order to be loaded and used from a Context in Java, a CJS module needs to be bundled into a self-contained JavaScript source file.This can be done using one of the many popular open-source bundling tools such as Parcel, Browserify and Webpack.Experimental support for CommonJS modules can be enabled through the js.commonjs-require option as described below.Experimental support for CommonJS Npm modules in the Context API.The js.commonjs-require option provides a built-in require() function that can be used to load Npm-compatible CommonJS modules in a JavaScript Context.Currently, this is an experimental feature not for production usage.To enable CommonJS support, a JavaScript context can be created in the following way:Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; options = new HashMap&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();// Enable CommonJS experimental support.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-require&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);// (optional) folder where the Npm modules to be loaded are located.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-require-cwd&quot;, &quot;/path/to/root/folder&quot;);// (optional) initialization script to pre-define globals.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-global-properties&quot;, &quot;./globals.js&quot;);// (optional) Node.js built-in replacements as a comma separated list.options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements&quot;,            &quot;buffer:buffer/,&quot; +            &quot;path:path-browserify&quot;);// Create context with IO support and experimental options.Context cx = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)                            .allowExperimentalOptions(true)                            .allowIO(true)                            .options(options)                            .build();// Require a moduleValue module = cx.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;require(&#39;some-module&#39;);&quot;);Differences with Node.js built-in require() function.The Context built-in require() function can load regular Npm modules implemented in JavaScript, but cannot load native Npm modules.The built-in require() relies on the Truffle FileSystem, therefore I/O access needs to be enabled at context creation time using the allowIO option.The built-in require() aims to be largely compatible with Node.js, and we expect it to work with any Npm module that would work in a browser (e.g., created using a package bundler).Installing an Npm module to be used via the Context API.In order to be used from a JavaScript Context, an Npm module needs to be installed to a local folder.This can be done using GraalVM JavaScript’s npm install command like one would normally do for Node.js applications.At runtime, the option js.commonjs-require-cwd can be used to specify the main installation folder for Npm packages.The require() built-in function will resolve packages according to the default Node.js’ package resolution protocol starting from the directory specified via js.commonjs-require-cwd.When no directory is provided with the option, the current working directory of the application will be used.Node.js core modules mockups.Some JavaScript applications or Npm modules might need functionalities that are available in Node.js’ built-in modules (e.g., &#39;fs&#39;, &#39;buffer&#39;, etc.)Such modules are not available in the Context API.Thankfully, the Node.js community has developed high-quality JavaScript implementations for many Node.js core modules (e.g.,: the ‘buffer’ module for the browser).Such alternative module implementations can be exposed to a JavaScript Context using the js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements option, in the following way:options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-core-modules-replacements&quot;, &quot;buffer:my-buffer-implementation&quot;);As the code suggests, the option instructs the GraalVM JavaScript runtime to load a module called my-buffer-implementation when an application attempts to load the Node.js &#39;buffer&#39; built-in module using require(&#39;buffer&#39;).Global symbols pre-initialization.An Npm module or a JavaScript application might expect certain global properties to be defined in the global scope.For example, applications or modules might expect the Buffer global symbol to be defined in the JavaScript global object.The option js.commonjs-global-properties can be used to pre-initialize such global symbols using the Context API.The option can be used in the following way:options.put(&quot;js.commonjs-global-properties&quot;, &quot;./globals.js&quot;);Once specified, the file globals.js will be loaded at context creation time, that is, before any JavaScript source execution.An example globals.js file might perform the following initialization steps:// define an empty object called &#39;process&#39;globalThis.process = {}// define the &#39;Buffer&#39; global symbolglobalThis.Buffer = require(&#39;some-buffer-implementation&#39;).Buffer;The file will be executed at context creation time, and Buffer will be available as a global symbol in all new Context instances.",

Try the following to find outmore:graalpython -m ginstall --helpAs a slightly more exciting example, try:graalpython -m ginstall install numpyIf all goes well (also consider native dependencies of NumPy), you should beable to import numpy afterwards.Support for more extension modules is high priority for us. We are activelybuilding out our support for the Python C API to make extensions such as NumPy,SciPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Tensorflow and the like work. This work means thatsome other extensions might also already work, but we’re not actively testingother extensions right now and cannot promise anything.

                    "content": "Profiling Truffle InterpretersThere is no shortage of tools for profiling interpreters written usingTruffle. When running in JVM mode, we can use standard JVM tooling, such asVisualVM, Java Flight Recorder and Oracle Developer Studio. When run as a Native Image we can usecallgrind from the Valgrind tool suite and other system tools, such as strace.As a GraalVM language we can also use other GraalVM tools. For a broad enoughdefinition of profiling, we can also use the Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) andC1 Visualizer to inspect Graal’s output.This document is less about how to use each tool and more about suggestions for extractingthe most useful information from the tools, assuming basic knowledge of their usage.Profiling with CPUSamplerThe simplest way to profile the application level, for example to find in whichguest-language function(s) most of the time is spent is to use the CPUSampler,which is part of the /tools suite and part of GraalVM. Simply pass --cpusamplerto your language launcher:$ my-language --cpusampler --cpusampler.Delay=MILLISECONDS -e &#39;p :hello&#39;You probably want to use a sampling delay with --cpusampler.Delay=MILLISECONDSto only start profiling after warmup. That way, you can easily identify whichfunctions get compiled and which do not and yet take a significant amount oftime to execute.See my-language --help:tools for more --cpusampler options.Creating a Flame Graph from CPUSamplerThe histogram output from the CPUSampler can be quite large, making it difficult toanalyze. Additionally, as a flat format it isn’t possible to analyze a call graph as thatinformation simply isn’t encoded in the output. A flame graph shows the entire call graphand its structure makes it considerably simpler to see where the application time is beingspent.Creating the flame graph is a multi-stage process. First, we need to profile the applicationwith the JSON formatter:$ my-language --cpusampler --cpusampler.SampleInternal --cpusampler.Mode=roots --cpusampler.Output=json -e &#39;p :hello&#39; &amp;gt; simple-app.jsonUse the --cpusampler.SampleInternal=true option if you want to profile internal sources, such as standard library functions.Using --cpusampler.Mode=roots option will sample each function, includinginlined functions, which is more intuitive when looking at a Flame Graph and canoften give a better idea of what is contributing to the overall method executiontime. However, --cpusampler.Mode=roots adds extra overhead, so you might wantto try without too. The default is to not include inlined functions in order tominimize overhead.The JSON profiler formatter encodes call graph information that isn’t available in thehistogram format. To make a flame graph out of this output, however, we need to transformit into a format that folds the call stack samples into single lines. This can be doneusing stackcollapse-graalvm.rbfrom Benoit’s fork of FlameGraph.If you haven’t yet, you should clone Benoit’s fork of FlameGraphinto the parent directory. Now you can run the script to transform the output andpipe it into the script that will generate the SVG data:$ ../FlameGraph/stackcollapse-graalvm.rb simple-app.json | ../FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl &amp;gt; simple-app.svgAt this point, you should open the SVG file in a Chromium-based web browser. Your systemmight have a different image manipulation application configured as the default applicationfor SVG files. While loading the file in such an application make render a graph, it likelywill not handle the interactive components of the flame graph. Firefox may work as well,but Chromium-based browsers seem to have better support and performance for the flame graphfiles as of this writing (Dec. 2018).Profiling with Oracle Developer StudioOracle Developer Studio includes aperformance analyzer that can be used with GraalVM.Developer Studio can be downloaded from OTNand the current version at time of writing (12.6) provides a perpetual no-cost license for production use and the development of commercial applications.Using Developer Studio Performance Analyser is straightforward, include the path to the Developer Studio binaries in your PATHand then prefix your normal command-line with collect, for example:$ collect js mybenchmark.jsOn completion an “experiment” (.er) directory will have been created containing the profiling data for the command execution, test.1.er by default.To view the profiling results, use the analyzer tool:$ analyzer test.1.erThe analyzer GUI allows you to view the captured profiling information in several different ways, for examplethe timeline of your application, a flat function list, the call tree, a flame graph etc. There is also a command-line tool,er_print which can be used for outputting the profiling information in textual form, for further analysis.For full details, see the Performance Analyzer documentation.",

The most important options include:  --jvm to enable Java interoperability  --polyglot to enable interoperability with other GraalVM languages  --vm.Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true to pass any options to the JVM, this will be translated to -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true.Note: unlike other GraalVM languages, R does not yet ship with aNative Image of its runtime.Therefore the --native option, which is the default, will still start Rscript on top of JVM,but for the sake of future compatibility the Java interoperability will not be available in such case.Users can optionally build the native image using:gu rebuild-images RNote that the native image of FastR is intended only for curious users and experiments.There are known issues and limitations. Once the native image was built, you can usethe --jvm flag to run FastR again in the JVM mode.GraalVM IntegrationThe R language integration with the GraalVM ecosystem includes:  seamless interop with other GraalVM languages and with Java  debugging with Chrome DevTools  CPU and memory profiling  VisualVM integrationTo start debugging the code start the R script with --inspect option$ Rscript --inspect myScript.RNote that GNU R compatible debugging using, for example, debug(myFunction) is also supported.",

You can use them from yourpom.xml file as:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-api&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;20.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- or any later version --&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.truffle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;truffle-dsl-processor&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;20.0.0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;Implement your own languageThe Truffle framework allows you to run programming languages efficiently on GraalVM.It simplifies language implementation by automatically deriving high-performance code from interpreters.Getting startedInformation on how to get starting building your language can be found in the Truffle language implementation tutorial.The reference API documentation is available as part of the Truffle javadoc.Start with looking at the TruffleLanguage class, which one should subclass to start developing a language.Truffle comes prebuilt with Graal and several language implementations as as part of GraalVM.A good way to start implementing your own Truffle language is to fork the SimpleLanguage project and start hacking.SimpleLanguage is a relatively small language implementation, well documented and designed to demonstrate most of the Truffle features.You could also try to get inspired by looking at code of one of existing open source Truffle language implementations and experiments.Reading The Graal/Truffle publications gives a very detailed view into how many of the aspects of Truffle work.However, as with any other software project, the source code is the ground truth.Advanced topicsImplementing a language using Truffle offers a way to interoperate with other Truffle Languages.To learn more about verifying that your language is a valid polyglot citizen, read more about using the Polyglot TCK.Somewhat related topics worth exploring are Truffle Libraries, as well as using them to implementing language interoperability.Truffle languages can also be embedded in Java host applications using the Polyglot API.To better understand how to improve the performance of your language please consult our documentation on profiling and optimizing your language.Also, to better understand how to use Truffle’s automated monomorphization feature (a.k.a. splitting), look at the related documentation.Implement your own toolGraalVM provides a framework for creating language-agnostic tools like debuggers, profilers, or other instrumentations.In general, GraalVM provides a standardized way to express and run program code enabling cross-language research and the development of tools that are developed once and then can be applied to any language.The reference API documentation is available as part of the Truffle javadoc.Start with looking at the TruffleInstrument class, which one should subclass to start developing a tool.If you want to implement your own Truffle tool, a good way to start is to fork the SimpleTool project and start hacking.SimpleTool is a minimalistic code-coverage tool which is well documented and designed to be a starting point for understanding the tool development process using Truffle.Since Truffle Tools instrument the language using the same AST-node-based approach, most of the techniques available to Truffle language developers in terms of improving performance are available to the tool developers as well.This is why we encourage you to understand how truffle works from a language developers perspective, in order to get the maximum out of your tool.CompatibilityThe Truffle API is evolved in a backwards compatible manner from one version to the next.When API is deprecated, then it will stay deprecated for at least two GraalVM releases and a minimum of one month before it will be removed.As a best practice it is recommended to upgrade Truffle only one version at a time.This way you can increment the version, fix deprecation warnings to continue with the next version.The deprecated Javadoc tags on the deprecated APIs are designed to be a guide on how to upgrade.The latest additions and changes can be seen in the changelog.Modifying TruffleTo understand how to modify Truffle, please consult the Truffle README file and if you would like to contribute to Truffle, consult the contribution documentation.",

Substrate VM is an internal projectname for the technology behind GraalVM Native Image.Quick startTo get started, install mx.Then point the JAVA_HOME variable to a JDK that supports a compatible versionof the JVM Compiler Interface (JVMCI). JVMCI is a privileged low-level interfaceto the JVM, that can read metadata from the VM such as method bytecode andinstall machine code into the VM. Obtain JVMCI-enabled:  JDK 8 from GitHub  JDK 11 from GitHubPrerequisitesFor compilation native-image depends on the local toolchain, so make sure: glibc-devel, zlib-devel (header files for the C library and zlib) and gcc are available on your system.Unlike Linux or macOS platforms, building native images on Windows requires meeting certain prerequisites.The required Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version depends on the JDK version thatGraalVM is based on. For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 8, you will need MSVC2010 SP1 version. The recommended installation method is using Microsoft WindowsSDK 7.1:  Download the SDK file GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso for from Microsoft.  Mount the image by opening F:SetupSDKSetup.exe directly.For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 11, you will need MSVC 2017 15.5.5 or later version.After cloning the repository, runcd substratevmmx buildecho &quot;public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;); } }&quot; &amp;gt; HelloWorld.java$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac HelloWorld.javamx native-image HelloWorld./helloworldTo build Truffle-based images please refer to the documentation in the VM suite.Build ScriptUsing Substrate VM requires the mx tool to be installed first, so that it is on your PATH.Visit the MX Homepage for more details.In the main directory, invoke mx help to see the list of commands.Most of the commands are inherited from the Graal and Truffle code bases.The most important commands for the Substrate VM are listed below.More information on the parameters of a command is available by running mx help &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;  build: Compile all Java and native code.  clean: Remove all compilation artifacts.  ideinit: Create project files for Eclipse and other common IDEs.See the documentation on IDE integration for details.Building imagesAfter running mx build you can use mx native-image to build native images.You can specify the main entry point, i.e., the application you want to create the image for.For more information run mx native-image --help.Native image generation is performed by a Java program that runs on a JVMCI-enabled JDK.You can debug it with a regular Java debugger.Use mx native-image --debug-attach to start native image generation so that it waits for a Java debugger to attach first (by default, at port 8000).In Eclipse, use the debugging configuration “substratevm-localhost-8000” to attach to it.This debugging configuration is automatically generated by mx ideinit.If you find yourself having to debug into the Graal level of SubstrateVM, proceed to the debugging page.You can use Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) to view individual compilation steps:mx igv &amp;amp;&amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;mx native-image HelloWorld -H:Dump= -H:MethodFilter=HelloWorld.*Images and Entry PointsAn native image can be built as a standalone executable, which is the default, or as a shared library by passing --shared to native-image.For an image to be useful, it needs to have at least one entry point method.For executables, Substrate VM supports Java main methods with a signature that takes the command line arguments as an array of strings:public static void main(String[] arg) { /* ... */ }For shared libraries, SVM provides the @CEntryPoint annotation to specify entry point methods that should be exported and callable from C.Entry point methods must be static and may only have non-object parameters and return types – this includes Java primitives, but also Word types (including pointers).One of the parameters of an entry point method has to be of type IsolateThread or Isolate.This parameter provides the current thread’s execution context for the call.For example:@CEntryPoint static int add(IsolateThread thread, int a, int b) {    return a + b;}Shared library builds generate an additional C header file.This header file contains declarations for the SVM C API, which allows creating isolates and attaching threads from C code, as well as declarations for each entry point in user code.The generated C declaration for the above example is:int add(graal_isolatethread_t* thread, int a, int b);Both executable images and shared library images can have an arbitrary number of entry points, for example to implement callbacks or APIs.OptionsMore information about options, and the important distinction between hosted and runtime options, is available here.Project StructureThe list of projects is defined in a custom format in the file mx.substratevm/suite.py.It is never necessary to create new projects in the IDE.Instead, a new project is created by adding it in suite.py and running mx ideinit to generate a corresponding IDE project.Code FormattingStyle rules and procedures for checking adherence are described in the style guide.Troubleshooting EclipseSometimes, Eclipse gives strange error messages, especially after pulling a bigger changeset.Also, projects are frequently added or removed, leading to error messages about missing projects if you do not import the new projects.The following should reset everything:  Delete all projects in Eclipse  mx clean  mx ideclean  mx fsckprojects  mx build  mx ideinit  Import all projects into Eclipse againLicenseThe Substrate VM is licensed under the GPL 2 with Classpath Exception.",

                    "content": "Reflection on Substrate VM(See also the guide on assisted configuration of Java reflection and other dynamic features)Java reflection support (the java.lang.reflect.* API) enables Java code to examine its own classes, methods and fields and their properties at runtime.Substrate VM has partial support for reflection and it needs to know ahead of time the reflectively accessed program elements.Examining and accessing program elements through java.lang.reflect.* or loading classes with Class.forName(String) at run time requires preparing additional metadata for those program elements.(Note: We include here loading classes with Class.forName(String) since it is closely related to reflection.)SubstrateVM tries to resolve the target elements through a static analysis that detects calls to the reflection API.Where the analysis fails the program elements reflectively accessed at run time must be specified using a manual configuration.Automatic detectionThe analysis intercepts calls to Class.forName(String), Class.forName(String, ClassLoader), Class.getDeclaredField(String), Class.getField(String), Class.getDeclaredMethod(String, Class[]), Class.getMethod(String, Class[]), Class.getDeclaredConstructor(Class[]) and Class.getConstructor(Class[]).If the arguments to these calls can be reduced to a constant we try to resolve the target elements.If the target elements can be resolved the calls are removed and instead the target elements are embedded in the code.If the target elements cannot be resolved, e.g., a class is not on the classpath or it doesn’t declare a field/method/constructor, then the calls are replaced with a snippet that throws the appropriate exception at run time.The benefits are two fold.First, at run time there are no calls to the reflection API.Second, Graal can employ constant folding and optimize the code further.The calls are intercepted and processed only when it can be unequivocally determined that the parameters can be reduced to a constant.For example the call Class.forName(String) will be replaced with a Class literal only if the String argument can be constant folded, assuming that the class is actually on the classpath.Additionally a call to Class.getMethod(String, Class[]) will be processed only if the contents of the Class[] argument can be determined with certainty.The last restriction is due to the fact that Java doesn’t have immutable arrays.Therefore all the changes to the array between the time it is allocated and the time it is passed as an argument need to be tracked.The analysis follows a simple rule: if all the writes to the array happen in linear sections of code, i.e., no control flow splits, then the array is effectively constant for the purpose of analyzing the call.That is why the analysis doesn’t accept Class[] arguments coming from static fields since the contents of those can change at any time, even if the fields are final.Although this may seem too restrictive it covers the most commonly used patterns of reflection API calls.The only exception to the constant arguments rule is that the ClassLoader argument of Class.forName(String, ClassLoader) doesn’t need to be a constant; it is ignored and instead a class loader that can load all the classes on the class path is used.The analysis runs to a fix point which means that a chain of calls like Class.forName(String).getMethod(String, Class[]) will first replace the class constant and then the method effectively reducing this to a java.lang.reflect.Method.Following are examples of calls that can be intercepted and replaced with the corresponding element:Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;)Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;, true, ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader())Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.Integer&quot;).getMethod(&quot;equals&quot;, Object.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;bitCount&quot;, int.class)Integer.class.getConstructor(String.class)Integer.class.getDeclaredConstructor(int.class)Integer.class.getField(&quot;MAX_VALUE&quot;)Integer.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;)The following ways to declare and populate an array are equivalent from the point of view of the analysis:Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params0 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[]{String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params0);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params1 = new Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[2];params1[0] = Class.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;);params1[1] = int.class;Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params1);Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt;[] params2 = {String.class, int.class};Integer.class.getMethod(&quot;parseInt&quot;, params2);If a call cannot be processed it is simply skipped.For these situations a manual configuration as described below can be provided.Manual configurationA configuration that specifies the program elements that will be accessed reflectively can be provided during the image build as follows:-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=/path/to/reflectconfigwhere reflectconfig is a JSON file in the following format (use --expert-options for more details):[  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.lang.Class&quot;,    &quot;allDeclaredConstructors&quot; : true,    &quot;allPublicConstructors&quot; : true,    &quot;allDeclaredMethods&quot; : true,    &quot;allPublicMethods&quot; : true,    &quot;allDeclaredClasses&quot; : true,    &quot;allPublicClasses&quot; : true  },  {    &quot;name&quot; : &quot;java.lang.String&quot;,    &quot;fields&quot; : [      { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;value&quot;, &quot;allowWrite&quot;

: &quot;compare&quot; }    ]  }]The image build generates reflection metadata for all classes, methods and fields referenced in that file.The allPublicConstructors, allDeclaredConstructors, allPublicMethods, allDeclaredMethods, allPublicFields, allDeclaredFields, allPublicClasses and allDeclaredClasses attributes can be used to automatically include an entire set of members of a class.However, allPublicClasses and allDeclaredClasses don’t automatically register the inner classes for reflective access.They just make them available via Class.getClasses() and Class.getDeclaredClasses() when called on the declaring class.In order to write a field that is declared final, the allowWrite attribute must be specified for that field (but is not required for non-final fields).However, code accessing final fields might not observe changes of final field values in the same way as for non-final fields because of optimizations.More than one configuration can be used by specifying multiple paths for ReflectionConfigurationFiles and separating them with ,.Also, -H:ReflectionConfigurationResources can be specified to load one or several configuration files from the native image build’s class path, such as from a JAR file.Alternatively, a custom Feature implementation can register program elements before and during the analysis phase of the native image build using the RuntimeReflection class.For example:@AutomaticFeatureclass RuntimeReflectionRegistrationFeature implements Feature {  public void beforeAnalysis(BeforeAnalysisAccess access) {    try {      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class);      RuntimeReflection.register(/* finalIsWritable: */ true, String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;value&quot;));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredField(&quot;hash&quot;));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredConstructor(char[].class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;charAt&quot;, int.class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;format&quot;, String.class, Object[].class));      RuntimeReflection.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class);      RuntimeReflection.register(String.CaseInsensitiveComparator.class.getDeclaredMethod(&quot;compare&quot;, String.class, String.class));    } catch (NoSuchMethodException | NoSuchFieldException e) { ... }  }}Use during Native Image GenerationReflection can be used without restrictions during native image generation, for example in static initializers.At this point, code can collect information about methods and fields and store them in own data structures, which are then reflection-free at run time.Unsafe accessesThe Unsafe class, although its use is discouraged, provides direct access to memory of Java objects. The Unsafe.objectFieldOffset() method provides the offset of a field within a Java object. This information is not available by default, but can be enabled with the allowUnsafeAccess attribute in the reflection configuration, for example:&quot;fields&quot; : [ { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;hash&quot;, &quot;allowUnsafeAccess&quot; : true }, ... ]Note that offsets that are queried during native image generation can be different to the offsets at runtime.",

                    "content": "Reporting Polymorphic Specializations to the RuntimeThis document gives a short overview of what is required of languageimplementers in order to leverage the monomorphization (splitting) strategy.More information on how it works can be found in the Splittingfile.In simple terms, the monomorphization heuristic relies on the languagereporting polymorphic specializations for each node that could potentially bereturned to a monomorphic state through splitting. In this context apolymorphic specialization is any node rewriting which results in the nodechanging “how polymorphic” it is. This includes, but is not limited to,activating another specialization, increasing the number of instances of anactive specialization, excluding a specialization, etc.Manual Reporting of Polymorphic SpecializationsTo facilitate reporting of polymorphic specializations we introduce a new APIinto the Node class:Node#reportPolymorphicSpecialize.This method can be used to manually report polymorphic specializations, but onlyin cases when this cannot be automated by using the DSL.Automated Reporting of Polymorphic SpecializationsSince the Truffle DSL automates much of the transitions between specializations,we added the @ReportPolymorphism annotation for automated reporting ofpolymorphicspecializations.This annotation instructs the DSL to include checks for polymorphism afterspecializations and to call Node#reportPolymorphicSpecialize if needed.For an example on how to use this annotation, consider thecom.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes.SLStatementNode. It is the base class for allSimple Language nodes and, since the ReportPolymorphism annotation isinherited, simply annotating this class will enable reporting of polymorphicspecializations for all Simple Language nodes. Below is the diff of the changethat adds this annotation to he SLStatementNodediff --gita/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/nodes/SLStatementNode.javab/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/nodes/SLStatementNode.javaindex 788cc20..89448b2 100644---a/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/nodes/SLStatementNode.java+++b/truffle/src/com.oracle.truffle.sl/src/com/oracle/truffle/sl/nodes/SLStatementNode.java@@ -43,6 +43,7 @@ package com.oracle.truffle.sl.nodes; import java.io.File;  import com.oracle.truffle.api.CompilerDirectives.TruffleBoundary;+import com.oracle.truffle.api.dsl.ReportPolymorphism; import com.oracle.truffle.api.frame.VirtualFrame; import com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.GenerateWrapper; import com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.InstrumentableNode;@@ -62,6 +63,7 @@ import com.oracle.truffle.api.source.SourceSection;  */ @NodeInfo(language = &quot;SL&quot;, description = &quot;The abstract base node for all SLstatements&quot;) @GenerateWrapper+@ReportPolymorphism public abstract class SLStatementNode extends Node implementsInstrumentableNode {      private static final int NO_SOURCE = -1;Controlling Automated Reporting of Polymorphic SpecializationsApplying the ReportPolymorphism annotation to all nodes of a language is thesimplest way to facilitate the monomorphization, but it could cause reportingof polymorphic specializations in cases where that does not necessarily makesense. In order to give the language developer more control over which nodesand which specializations are taken into consideration for reportingpolymorphism we introduced the @ReportPolymorphism.Excludeannotationwhich is applicable to classes (disabling automated reporting for the entireclass) or to individual specializations (excluding those specializations fromconsideration when checking for polymorphism).Tools SupportKnowing which nodes should and should not report polymorphic specializations isfor the language developer to conclude through either knowledge of the languagein question, or though experimentation with the effects of including/excludingparticular nodes/specializations. To aid language developers in betterunderstanding the impact of reporting polymorphic specializations we providesome tool support that could be useful for this task.Tracing individual splitsAdding the --engine.TraceSplitting argument to the command linewhen executing your guest language code will, in real time, print informationabout each split the runtime makes.A small part of the output from running one of the JavaScript benchmarks withsaid flag enabled follows....[engine] split   0-37d4349f-1     multiplyScalar |ASTSize      40/   40 |Calls/Thres       2/    3 |CallsAndLoop/Thres       2/ 1000 |Inval#              0 |SourceSection octane-raytrace.js~441-444:12764-12993[engine] split   1-2ea41516-1     :anonymous |ASTSize       8/    8 |Calls/Thres       3/    3 |CallsAndLoop/Thres       3/ 1000 |Inval#              0 |SourceSection octane-raytrace.js~269:7395-7446[engine] split   2-3a44431a-1     :anonymous |ASTSize      28/   28 |Calls/Thres       4/    5 |CallsAndLoop/Thres       4/ 1000 |Inval#              0 |SourceSection octane-raytrace.js~35-37:1163-1226[engine] split   3-3c7f66c4-1     Function.prototype.apply |ASTSize      18/   18 |Calls/Thres       7/    8 |CallsAndLoop/Thres       7/ 1000 |Inval#              0 |SourceSection octane-raytrace.js~36:1182-1219...Tracing a splitting summaryAdding the --engine.TraceSplittingSummary argument to the commandline when executing your guest language code will, after the execution iscomplete, print out a summary of the gathered data regarding splitting.

This option will print, in real time, a log detailing which nodes are reporting polymorphism and how that is affecting the call targets.Let’s consider a couple of examples:Example 1[engine] [poly-event] Polymorphic event! Source: JSObjectWriteElementTypeCacheNode@e3c0e40   WorkerTask.run[engine] [poly-event] Early return: false callCount: 1, numberOfKnownCallNodes: 1            WorkerTask.runThis log section tells us that the JSObjectWriteElementTypeCacheNode in the WorkerTask.run method turned polymorphic and reported it.It also tells us that this is the first time that WorkerTask.run is being executed (callCount: 1), thus we don’t mark it as “needs split” (Early return: false)Example 2[engine] [poly-event] Polymorphic event!

Note thateven a call to Bindings#get(String) may lead to context initialization.The following code shows how to enable polyglot.js.allowHostAccess via Bindings:ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(&quot;JavaScript&quot;);Bindings bindings = engine.getBindings(ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE);bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostAccess&quot;, true);bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostClassLookup&quot;, (Predicate&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;) s -&amp;gt; true);bindings.put(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new Object());engine.eval(&quot;(javaObj instanceof Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Object&#39;));&quot;); // would not work without allowHostAccess and allowHostClassLookupThis example would not work if the user would call e.g. engine.eval(&quot;var x = 1;&quot;) before calling bindings.put(&quot;polyglot.js.allowHostAccess&quot;, true);, sinceany call to eval forces context initialization.Setting options via System PropertiesOptions to the JavaScript engine can be set via System Properties before starting the JVM by prepending polyglot.:java -Dpolyglot.js.ecmascript-version=2020 MyApplicationor programmatically from within Java before creating the ScriptEngine.This, however, only works for the options passed to the JavaScript engine (like js.ecmascript), but not for the six options mentioned above that can be set via the Bindings.Another caveat is that those system properties are shared by all concurrently executed ScriptEngines.Manually creating Context for more flexibilityContext options can also be passed to GraalJSScriptEngine directly, via an instance of Context.Builder:ScriptEngine engine = GraalJSScriptEngine.create(null,        Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)        .allowHostAccess(HostAccess.ALL)        .allowHostClassLookup(s -&amp;gt; true)        .option(&quot;js.ecmascript-version&quot;, &quot;2020&quot;));engine.put(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new Object());engine.eval(&quot;(javaObj instanceof Java.type(&#39;java.lang.Object&#39;));&quot;);This allows setting all options available in GraalVM JavaScript.It does come at the cost of a hard dependency on GraalVM JavaScript, e.g. the GraalJSScriptEngine and Context classes.Supported file extensionsThe GraalVM JavaScript implementation of javax.script.ScriptEngine supports the js file extension for JavaScript source files, as well as the mjs extension for ES modules.",

                    "content": "How it works - SplittingThis document gives a short overview of the algorithm used in theimplementation of Truffle call target splitting.The new implementation relies on the language implementations providinginformation on when a particular node turns polymorphic or increases its“degree” of polymorphism by for example adding an entry into an inline cache. Wecall this event a “polymorphic specialize”.  This information is provided to theruntime by calling theNode.reportPolymorphicSpecializemethod after the specialization is complete. In this document we will only lookat what happens after the call to reportPolymorphicSpecialize. You can findmore information on how to correctly report polymorphic specializations in theReporting Polymorphism file.The ApproachDetecting of suitable splitting candidates relies on the languages reportingpolymorphic specializations. Once the specialization is reported we make theassumption that the polymorphism is coming from somewhere in the caller chain ofthe call target hosting the newly polymorphic node, and that by splitting theright call target (or call targets) we can return this node to a monomorphicstate.We identify the call targets for which we conclude that splitting could resultin monomorphization and mark them as “needs split”. During further execution, ifthe interpreter is about to execute a direct call to a call target that ismarked as “needs split”, that call target will be split (provided there are nooutstanding factors preventing it such as the root node not being allowed to besplit,the AST being too big, etc.). This results in a new call target with a cleanprofile (i.e. all its nodes are returned to an uninitialized state) to bere-profiled specifically for this call site, since it is the only call sitecalling this new call target.Following recursive algorithm (expressed as pseudo code) is a simplified versionof the approach used to decide which call targets need to be marked “needssplit”. This algorithm is applied to every call target once one of its nodesreports a polymorphic specialization. The full implementation can be found inorg.graalvm.compiler.truffle.runtime.OptimizedCallTarget#maybeSetNeedsSplitsetNeedsSplit(callTarget)    if callTarget.needsSplit        return false    if sizeof(knownCallers(callTarget)) == 0        return false    if callCount(callTarget) == 1        return false    if sizeof(knownCallers(callTarget)) &amp;gt; 1        callTarget.needsSplit = true    else        callTarget.needsSplit = setNeedsSplit(caller(callTarget))        return callTarget.needsSplitAt the very beginning of the pseudo code we have several early terminationconditions. If the call target is already marked as “needs split” we have noneed to continue. Also, if the call targets has no known callers (e.g. it is the“main” of the execution) splitting is not applicable since splitting isinherently tied to duplicating ASTs for a particular call site. Finally, if thisis happening during the first execution of call target, splitting is pointlesssince the polymorphic nature of the node is inevitable (i.e. not coming from thecallers, but rather an integral property of that call target).In the second part of the pseudo code we differentiate two cases:1) The call target has multiple known callers - in this case we can assume that thepolymorphism is coming from one of these multiple callers. Thus, we mark thecall target as “needs split”.2) The call target has only one known caller - in this case we know that markingthis call target as “needs split” cannot help remove the polymorphism. But, thepolymorphism could be coming into this call target from its sole caller, whichcould have multiple callers and could be a candidate for splitting. Thus, werecursively apply the algorithm to the caller of our call target.Ignore for now the return value of our algorithm and its usage, and consider thefollowing Simple Language example to illustrate why this distinction between oneand multiple callers is needed:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    double(1);    double(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}In this example, the node representing + in the add function will turnpolymorphic once double is called with the string argument &quot;foo&quot; and thiswill be reported to the runtime and our algorithm will be applied to add. Allof the early return checks will fail (add is not marked “needs split”, it hasknown callers and this is not its first execution). We observe that add hasonly one caller (double) so we apply the algorithm to double. Early returnsall fail, and since double has multiple callers we mark it as “needs split”and on later iterations calls to double are split resulting in the followingcode representation of the run time state:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2; // + is polymorphic}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit1(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit2(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    doubleSplit1(1);    doubleSplit2(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}As we can see, we did split the source of the polymorphism, but we did not solvethe issue, since both slits still call the same add function and thepolymorphism remains. This is where the algorithms return value comes in toplay. If the algorithm was successful in finding a target to mark than all thetransitive callee’s of that target need to be marked “needs split” as well. Withthis final step in place, the final run time result of our splitting approachfor the previous example can be represent as the following source code:function add(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2; // + is polymorphic}function addSplit1(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function addSplit2(arg1, arg2) {    return arg1 + arg2;}function double(arg1) {    return add(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit1(arg1) {    return addSplit1(arg1, arg1);}function doubleSplit2(arg1) {    return addSplit2(arg1, arg1);}function callsDouble() {    doubleSplit1(1);    doubleSplit2(&quot;foo&quot;);}function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }}Final note to observe at this point is that the splitting does not remove theoriginal call targets, and that they still have polymorphism in their profiles.Thus, even if new calls to these call targets are created, they will also besplit. Consider if the main of the previous example looked as follows.function main() {    i = 0;    while (i &amp;lt; 1000) {        callsDouble();    }    add(1,2); // this line was added}Once the execution reaches the newly added line we do not want it to call theadd function with the polymorphic + since the arguments here don’t merit thepolymorphism. Luckily, since add was already marked as “needs split” it willremain so during the entire execution, and the this finall call to add withcause another split of the add functions.",

When running the tests all LanguageProviders in the primary suiteand dependent suites are used. The truffle suite provides the java-host LanguageProvider creating java datatypes and Proxies totest java inter-operability.To run just the TCK tests use:mx unittest com.oracle.truffle.tck.testsor simply:mx tckTo restrict the TCK tests to test certain language use the tck.language property.

Read this tutorial first before using it.Getting StartedThis tutorial provides a trace through a use-case on how to use Truffle Libraries. The full API documentation can be found in the javadoc. This document assumes prior knowledge of Truffle APIs and the use of @Specialization with the @Cached annotation.Motivating ExampleWhen implementing arrays in Truffle Languages it is often necessary to use multiple representations for efficiency. For example, if the array is constructed from an arithmetic sequence of integers (e.g., range(from: 1, step: 2, length: 3)), then it is best represented using the start, stride and length instead of materializing the full array. Of course, when an array element is written then the array needs to be materialized. In this example we are going to implement an array implementation with two representations:  Buffer: represents a materialized array representation backed by a Java array.  Sequence: represents an arithmetic sequence of numbers represented by start, stride and length: [start, start + 1 * stride, ..., start + (length - 1) * stride].To keep the example simple we will only support int values and we will ignore index bounds error handling. We will also just implement the read operation and not the typically more complicated write operation.To make the example more interesting, we will implement an optimization that will let the compiler allow to constant fold sequenced array accesses even if the array receiver value is not constant. Let’s assume we have the following code snippet range(start, stride, length)[2]. In this snippet, the variables start and stride are not known to be constant values, therefore, equivalent code to start + stride * 2 gets compiled. However, if the start and stride values are known to always be the same then the compiler could constant-fold the entire operation. This optimization requires the use of caching, we will see later how this works.In the dynamic array implementation of Graal.js, we use 20 different representations. There are representations for constant, zero-based, contiguous, holes and sparse arrays. Some representations are further specialized for the types byte, int, double, JSObject and Object. The source code can be found here. Note that currently, JS arrays don’t use Truffle Libraries yet.In the following sections, we discuss multiple implementation strategies for the array representations, ultimately describing how Truffle Libraries can be used to achieve this.Strategy 1: Specialization per representationFor this strategy, we will start by declaring classes for the two representations BufferArray and SequenceArray.final class BufferArray {    int length;    int[] buffer;    /*...*/}final class SequenceArray {    final int start;    final int stride;    final int length;    /*...*/}The BufferArray implementation has a mutable buffer and length and is used as the materialized array representation. The sequence array is represented by the final fields start, stride and length.Now, let’s specify the basic read operations like this:abstract class ExpressionNode extends Node {    abstract Object execute(VirtualFrame frame);}@NodeChild @NodeChildabstract class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization    int doBuffer(BufferArray array, int index) {        return array.buffer[index];    }    @Specialization    int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {        return seq.start + seq.stride * index;    }}The array read node specifies two specializations for the buffer version and the sequence. As mentioned before we are going to ignore error bounds checks for simplicity.Now let’s try to make the array read specialize on the constant-ness of values of the sequence in order to allow the range(start, stride, length)[2] example fold if start and stride are constant. To find out whether start and stride are constants we need to profile their value. To profile these values we need to add another specialization to the array read operation like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    /* doBuffer() */    @Specialization(guards = {&quot;seq.stride == cachedStride&quot;,                              &quot;seq.start  == cachedStart&quot;}, limit = &quot;1&quot;)    int doSequenceCached(SequenceArray seq, int index,             @Cached(&quot;seq.start&quot;)  int cachedStart,             @Cached(&quot;seq.stride&quot;) int cachedStride) {        return cachedStart + cachedStride * index;    }    /* doSequence() */}If the speculation guards of this specialization succeed then the start and stride are effectively constant, e.g. with the values 3 and 2, the compiler would see 3 + 2 * 2 which is 7. The limit is set to 1 to only try this speculation once. It is likely to not be efficient to increase the limit as this would introduce additional control flow to the compiled code. If the speculation does not succeed, i.e. if the operation observes multiple start and stride values we want to fall back to the normal sequence specialization. To achieve this we change the doSequence specialization by adding replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot; like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    /* doSequenceCached() */    @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot;)    int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {        return seq.start + seq.stride * index;    }}Now we have achieved the goal of implementing our array representations including additional profiling. The runnable source code for strategy 1 can be found here.This strategy has some nice properties:  The operation is easy to read and all cases are fully enumerated.  The generated code of the read node only requires a single bit per specialization to remember which representation type was observed at runtime.We would already be done with this tutorial if there wouldn’t be some problems with this:  New representations cannot be loaded dynamically, they need to be statically known, making the separation of representation types from operations impossible.  Changing or adding representation types often requires to modify many operations.  Representation classes need to expose most implementation details to operations (no encapsulation).These problems are the primary motivations for Truffle Libraries.Strategy 2: Java InterfacesLet’s try to address these problems by using Java interfaces. We start by defining an array interface:interface Array {    int read(int index);}The implementations can now implement the Array interface and implement the read method in the representation class.final class BufferArray implements Array {    private int length;    private int[] buffer;    /*...*/    @Override public int read(int index) {        return buffer[index];    }}final class SequenceArray implements Array {    private final int start;    private final int stride;    private final int length;    /*...*/    @Override public int read(int index) {        return start + (stride * index);    }}Finally lets specify the operation node:@NodeChild @NodeChildabstract class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization   int doDefault(Array array, int index) {        return array.read(index);    }}This operation implementation has the problem that the partial evaluator does not know which concrete type the array receiver has. It, therefore, needs to stop partial evaluation and emit a slow interface call for the read method call. This is not what we want, but we can introduce a polymorphic type cache to resolve it like this:class ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization(guards = &quot;array.getClass() == arrayClass&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    int doCached(Array array, int index,           @Cached(&quot;array.getClass()&quot;) Class&amp;lt;? extends Array&amp;gt; arrayClass) {        return arrayClass.cast(array).read(index);    }    @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doCached&quot;)    int doDefault(Array array, int index) {        return array.read(index);    }}Now we solved the problem of partially evaluating the implementation, but there is no way to express the extra specialization for the constant stride and start index optimization in this solution.This is what we solved so far:  Interfaces are existing well-known concept for polymorphism in Java.  New interface implementations can be loaded enabling modularity.  A convenient way to use the operations from slow-paths.  Representation types can encapsulate implementation details.But we have introduced new problems:  No representation specific profiling / caching can be performed.  Every interface call requires a polymorphic class cache on the call-site.The runnable source code for strategy 2 can be found here.Strategy 3: Truffle LibrariesTruffle Libraries work similar to the Java interfaces. Instead of a Java interface, we create an abstract class extending the Library class and annotate it with @GenerateLibrary. We create abstract methods like with the interface but we insert a receiver argument in the beginning, in our case of type Object. Instead of performing interface type checks we use an explicit abstract method in the library typically named is${Type}.Let’s do this for our example:@GenerateLibrarypublic abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {    public boolean isArray(Object receiver) {        return false;    }    public abstract int read(Object receiver, int index);}This ArrayLibrary specifies two messages: isArray and read. At compile time, the annotation processor generates a package protected class ArrayLibraryGen. Unlike generated nodes classes, you never need to refer to this class.Instead of implementing a Java interface, we export the library using the @ExportLibrary annotation on the representation type. Message exports are specified using instance methods on the representation and can, therefore, omit the receiver argument of the library.The first representation we implement this way is the BufferArray representation:@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class BufferArray {    private int length;    private int[] buffer;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage boolean isArray() {      return true;    }    @ExportMessage int read(int index) {      return buffer[index];    }}This implementation is very similar to the interface version, but in addition, we specify the isArray message. Again, the annotation processor generates the boilerplate code that implements the library abstract class.Next, we implement the sequence representation. We start by implementing it without the optimization for the start and stride value.@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class SequenceArray {    private final int start;    private final int stride;    private final int length;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage int read(int index) {        return start + stride * index;    }}So far this was equivalent to the interface implementation, but with Truffle Libraries we can now also use specializations in our representations by exporting a message using a class instead of a method. The convention is that the class is named exactly like the exported message, but with the first letter upper-case.Let’s implement our stride and start specialization using this mechanism:@ExportLibrary(ArrayLibrary.class)final class SequenceArray {    final int start;    final int stride;    final int length;    /*...*/    @ExportMessage static class Read {        @Specialization(guards = {&quot;seq.stride == cachedStride&quot;,                                  &quot;seq.start  == cachedStart&quot;}, limit = &quot;1&quot;)        static int doSequenceCached(SequenceArray seq, int index,                 @Cached(&quot;seq.start&quot;)  int cachedStart,                 @Cached(&quot;seq.stride&quot;) int cachedStride) {            return cachedStart + cachedStride * index;        }        @Specialization(replaces = &quot;doSequenceCached&quot;)        static int doSequence(SequenceArray seq, int index) {            return doSequenceCached(seq, index, seq.start, seq.stride);        }    }}Since the message is declared using an inner class we need to specify the receiver type.Compared to normal nodes, this class must not extend Node and its methods must be static to allow the annotation processor to generate efficient code for the library subclass.Last, we need to use the array library in our read operation. The Library API provides an annotation called @CachedLibrary that is responsible for dispatching to libraries. The array read operation now looks like this:@NodeChild @NodeChildclass ArrayReadNode extends ExpressionNode {    @Specialization(guards = &quot;arrays.isArray(array)&quot;, limit = &quot;2&quot;)    int doDefault(Object array, int index,                  @CachedLibrary(&quot;array&quot;) ArrayLibrary arrays) {        return arrays.read(array, index);    }}Similar to the type cache we have seen in strategy 2 we specialize the library to a particular value. The first attribute of @CachedLibrary, &quot;array&quot; specifies the value the library is specialized for. A specialized library can only be used for values they were specialized for. If they are used with other values then the framework will fail with an assertion error.Instead of using the Array type as the parameter type, we use the isArray message in the guard. Using a specialized library requires us to specify the limit on the specialization. The limit specifies how many specializations of a library can be instantiated until the operation should rewrite itself to use an uncached version of the library. In the array example we have only implemented two array representations, therefore it is impossible that the limit is exceeded. In real array implementations, we are likely to use much more representations. The limit should be set to a value that is unlikely to be exceeded in representative applications, but at the same time does not produce too much code.The uncached or slow-path version of a library can be reached by exceeding the limit of the specialization, but it can also be used manually. For example, if the array operation needs to be invoked when no node is available. This is usually the case for parts of the language implementation that are invoked infrequently. With the interface strategy (Strategy 2) the array read operation could be used by just invoking the interface method.With Truffle libraries, we need to lookup an uncached version of the library first. Every use of @ExportLibrary generates a cached but also an uncached / slow-path library subclass. The uncached version of the exported library use the same semantics as @GenerateUncached. Typically, as with our example, the uncached version can be derived automatically. The DSL shows an error if it needs further details on how to generate the uncached version. The uncached version of the library can be invoked like this:ArrayLibrary arrays = LibraryFactory.resolve(ArrayLibrary.class).getUncached();arrays.read(array, index);In order to decrease the verbosity of this example, it is recommended that the library class provides the following optional static utilities:@GenerateLibrarypublic abstract class ArrayLibrary extends Library {    /*...*/    public static LibraryFactory&amp;lt;ArrayLibrary&amp;gt; getFactory() {        return FACTORY;    }    public static ArrayLibrary getUncached() {        return FACTORY.getUncached();    }    private static final LibraryFactory&amp;lt;ArrayLibrary&amp;gt; FACTORY =               LibraryFactory.resolve(ArrayLibrary.class);}The verbose example from above can now be simplified as:ArrayLibrary.getUncached().readArray(array, index);The runnable source code for strategy 3 can be found here.ConclusionIn this tutorial, we have learned that with Truffle Libraries we no longer need to compromise the modularity of representation types by creating a specialization per representation (Strategy 1) and the profiling is no longer blocked by interface calls (Strategy 2). With Truffle Libraries we now support polymorphic dispatch with type encapsulation but don’t lose the capability of using profiling/caching techniques in representation types.What to do next?      Run and debug all the examples here.        Read the interop migration guide, as an example of Truffle libraries usage here.        Read the Truffle Library reference documentation here.  FAQAre there known limitations?  Library exports currently cannot explicitly invoke their super implementation. This makes reflective implementations currently infeasible. See the example here.  Boxing elimination for return values is currently not supported. A message can only have one generic return type. Support for this is planned.  Reflection without static dependencies on the Library class is currently not supported. Support for full dynamic reflection is planned.When should I use Truffle Libraries?When to use?  If the representations are modular and cannot be enumerated for an operation. (e.g. Truffle Interoperability)  If there are more than one representations of a type and one of the representation needs profiling/caching. (e.g. see the motivating example)  If there is a need for a way to proxy all values of a language. (e.g. for dynamic taint tracking)When not to use?  For basic types that only have one representation.  For primitive representations that require boxing elimination to speed up the interpreter. Boxing elimination is not supported with Truffle Libraries at the moment.I decided to use a Truffle Library to abstract the language specific types of my language. Should those be exposed to other languages and tools?All libraries are accessible to other languages and tools via the ReflectionLibrary. It is recommended that the language implementation documentation specifies which libraries and messages are intended for external use, and which ones may be subject to breaking changes.What happens when a new method is added to a library but a dynamically loaded implementation hasn’t been updated for it?If the library method was specified abstract then an AbstractMethodError will be thrown. Otherwise the default implementation specified by the library method body will be called. This allows to customize the error in case an abstract method is used. For example, for Truffle interoperability we often throw an UnsupportedMessageException instead of an AbstractMethodError.",

                    "title": "Native Image",
                    "content": "GraalVM Native ImageGraalVM Native Image allows you to ahead-of-time compile Java code to a standalone executable, calleda native image. This executable includes the application classes, classesfrom its dependencies, runtime library classes from JDK and statically linkednative code from JDK. It does not run on the Java VM, but includes necessarycomponents like memory management and thread scheduling from a different virtualmachine, called “Substrate VM”. Substrate VM is the name for the runtimecomponents (like the deoptimizer, garbage collector, thread scheduling etc.).The resulting program has faster startup time and lower runtime memory overheadcompared to a Java VM.Native Image Generator or native-image is a utility that processes all the classes of your application and their dependencies, including those from the JDK. It statically analyses these classesto determine which classes and methods are reachable and used during applicationexecution. Then it passes all this reachable code as the input to the GraalVMcompiler which ahead-of-time compiles it to the native binary.GraalVM native-image supports JVM-based languages, e.g., Java, Scala,Clojure, Kotlin. The resulting native image can, optionally, execute dynamiclanguages like JavaScript, Ruby, R, or Python, but it does not pre-compile their codeitself. Polyglot embeddings can also be compiled ahead-of-time. To informnative-image of guest languages used by an application, specify--language:&amp;lt;languageId&amp;gt; for each guest language used (e.g., --language:js).Note: GraalVM Enterprise Native Image isavailable as an Early Adopter technology. GraalVM Community Native Image is licensed under the GPL 2 with Classpath Exception.Install Native ImageNative Image is distributed as a separate installable and can be added to the core installation with GraalVM Updater utility in a similar way as other additional components.For GraalVM Community users, install a component from the GitHub catalog byits name gu install native-image.For GraalVM Enterprise users, download the Native Image component JARfile from Oracle Technology Network and install itby running gu -L install component.jar, where -L option, equivalent to--local-file or --file, tells to install a component from a downloaded archive.After this additional step, the native-image executable will become available inthe bin directory, as for the previous releases.Take a look at the native image generation or compiling a Java and Kotlin app ahead-of-time samples.PrerequisitesFor compilation native-image depends on the local toolchain, so please makesure: glibc-devel, zlib-devel (header files for the C library and zlib)and gcc are available on your system. For Linux platform, install libstdc++dependency additionally. For instance, on Oracle Linux run:yum install libstdc++-static`Another prerequisite to consider is the maximum heap size. Physical memory forrunning a JVM-based application may be insufficient to build a native image. Forserver-based image building we allow to use 80% of the reported physical RAM forall servers together, but never more than 14GB per server (for exact detailsplease consult the native-image source code). If you run with --no-serveroption, you will get the whole 80% of what is reported as physical RAM as thebaseline. This mode respects -Xmx arguments additionally.Prerequisites for Using Native Image on WindowsTo make use of Native Image on Windows, follow the further recommendations. Therequired Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version depends on the JDK version thatGraalVM is based on. For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 8, you will need MSVC2010 SP1 version. The recommended installation method is using Microsoft WindowsSDK 7.1:  Download the SDK file GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso for from Microsoft.  Mount the image by opening F:SetupSDKSetup.exe directly.For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 11, you will need MSVC 2017 15.5.5 or later version.The last prerequisite, common for both GraalVM distribution based on JDK 11 and JDK 8, is the proper Developer Command Prompt for your version of Visual Studio. Namely, it is should be the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. Use Visual Studio 2017 or later.Image Generation OptionsThe native-image command line needs to provide the class path for all classesusing the familiar option from the java launcher: -cp is followed by a listof directories or .jar files, separated by :. The name of the class containingthe main method is the last argument; or you can use -jar and provide a .jarfile that specifies the main method in its manifest. The syntax of the native-image command is:      native-image [options] class to build an executable file for a class in thecurrent working directory. Invoking it executes the native-compiled code of thatclass.        native-image [options] -jar jarfile to build an image for a jar file.  There is a command-line help available. Run native-image --help to getcommands overview and native-image --help-extra to print help on non-standardoptions.You may provide additional options to the native image building:      -cp and --class-path &amp;lt;class search path of directories and zip/jar files&amp;gt;  help to search for class files through separated list of directories, JAR archives, and ZIP archives        -D&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; sets a system property for the JVM running the image generator        -J&amp;lt;flag&amp;gt; passes &amp;lt;flag&amp;gt; directly to the JVM running the image generator        -O&amp;lt;level&amp;gt; 0 – no optimizations, 1 – basic optimizations (default)        -ea and -da enables or disables assertions in the generated image        --allow-incomplete-classpath allows image building with an incomplete class path and reports type resolution errors at run time when they are accessed the first time, instead of during image building        --auto-fallback builds a stand-alone image if possible, which is a default setting, --no-fallback builds a stand-alone image or reports a failure, and --force-fallback forces building of a fallback image        --enable-all-security-services adds all security service classes to the generated image        --enable-http or --enable-https enables http or https support in the generated image        --enable-url-protocols provides a list of comma separated URL protocols to enable        --features=&amp;lt;fqcn&amp;gt; provides a comma-separated list of fully qualified feature implementation classes        --initialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;comma separated list of class/package names&amp;gt; initializes classes and implicitly all of their superclasses during image building        --initialize-at-run-time=&amp;lt;comma separated list of class/package names&amp;gt; initializes classes and implicitly all of their superclasses at run time and not during image building        --report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime reports usage of unsupported methods  and fields at run time when they are accessed the first time, instead of as an error during image building;        --shared builds a shared library        --static builds a statically linked executable. This option prevents linking against shared libraries. This requires the static libc and libstdc++ libraries to be available on the host system. Note:  On systems other than Linux, this option has no effect        --verbose makes image building output more verbose        -g enables the debugging info generation. Note: The option is available only with GraalVM Enterprise Edition  Macro OptionsMacro-options are mainly helpful for polyglot capabilities of native images:      --language:nfi to make Truffle Native Function Interface language available        --language:regex to make Truffle Regular Expression engine available that  exposes regular expression functionality in GraalVM supported languages        --language:js to make sure JavaScript is available as a language for the image        --language:llvm to make sure LLVM bitcode is available for the image        --language:python to make sure Python is available as a language for the image        --language:ruby to make sure Ruby is available as a language for the image        --language:R  to make sure R is available as a language for the image        --tool:chromeinspector  adds debugging support to a Truffle framework based language image        --tool:profiler adds profiling support to a Truffle framework based language image  Please note, the --language:python, --language:ruby and --language:R polyglot macro options become available once the corresponding languages engines are installed to the base GraalVM distribution.Non-standard OptionsGet acquainted with the non-standard native image building options, that are subject to change through a deprecation cycle:      --no-server tells to not use server-based image building        --server-list lists current image-build servers        --server-list-details lists current image-build servers with more details        --server-cleanup removes stale image-build servers entries        --server-shutdown shuts down image-build servers under current session ID        --server-shutdown-all shuts down all image-build servers        --server-session=&amp;lt;custom-session-name&amp;gt; uses custom session name instead   of system provided session ID of the calling process        --verbose-server enables verbose output for image-build server handling  Server-side Options      --debug-attach[=&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;] attaches to debugger during image building (default  port is 8000)        --dry-run outputs the command line that would be used for image building        --expert-options lists image build options for experts        --expert-options-all  lists all image build options for experts (to be used at your own risk)        --configurations-path &amp;lt;search path of option-configuration directories&amp;gt; a separated list of directories to be treated as option-configuration directories        -V&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; provides values for placeholders in native-image.properties files  For a more comprehensive list of options please check the documentation on Github.Native Image ConfigurationThe native-image tool supports a wide range of options to configure a native image build process.A recommended way to provide configuration is to embed anative-image.properties file into a project jar file. The Native Image toolwill automatically pick up all configuration options provided anywhere below theresource location META-INF/native-image/ and use it to constructnative-image command line arguments.To avoid a situation when constituent parts of a non-trivial project are builtwith overlapping configurations, we recommend to use “subdirectories” withinMETA-INF/native-image. That way a jar file built from multiple maven projectscannot suffer from overlapping native-image configurations. For example:  foo.jar has its configurations in META-INF/native-image/foo_groupID/foo_artifactID  bar.jar has its configurations in META-INF/native-image/bar_groupID/bar_artifactIDA jar file that contains foo and bar will then contain both configurationswithout conflicting with one another. Therefore the recommended layout forstoring native-image configuration data in jar files is the following:META-INF/└── native-image    └── groupID        └── artifactID            └── native-image.propertiesNote that the use of ${.} in a native-image.properties file expands to theresource location that contains that exact configuration file. This can beuseful if the native-image.properties file wants to refer to resources withinits “subfolder”, for example,-H:SubstitutionResources=${.}/substitutions.json.By having such a composable native-image.properties file, building an imagedoes not require any additional arguments specified on command line. It issufficient to just run the following command:$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image -jar target/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.jarTo debug which configuration data gets applied for the image building use native-image--verbose. This will show from where native-image picks up theconfigurations to construct the final composite configuration command lineoptions for the image builder.$ native-image --verbose -jar build/basic-app-0.1-all.jarApply jar:file://~/build/basic-app-0.1-all.jar!/META-INF/native-image/io.netty/common/native-image.propertiesApply jar:file://~/build/basic-app-0.1-all.jar!/META-INF/native-image/io.netty/buffer/native-image.propertiesApply jar:file://~/build/basic-app-0.1-all.jar!/META-INF/native-image/io.netty/transport/native-image.propertiesApply jar:file://~/build/basic-app-0.1-all.jar!/META-INF/native-image/io.netty/handler/native-image.propertiesApply jar:file://~/build/basic-app-0.1-all.jar!/META-INF/native-image/io.netty/codec-http/native-image.properties...Executing [    &amp;lt;composite configuration command line options for the image builder&amp;gt;]Typical examples of META-INF/native-image based native image configuration can be found in Native Image configuration examples.Properties File FormatA native-image.properties file is a regular Java properties file that can beused to specify native image configurations. The following properties aresupported.ArgsUse this property if your project requires custom native-image command line options to build correctly. For example, the native-image-configure-examples/configure-at-runtime-example has Args = --initialize-at-build-time=com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty$Access  in its native-image.properties file to ensure the class com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonProperty$Access gets initialized at image built time.JavaArgsSometimes it can be necessary to provide custom options to the JVM that runs theimage builder. The JavaArgs property can used in this case.ImageNameThis property can be used to specify a user-defined name for the image. IfImageName is not used, a name gets automatically chosen:  native-image -jar &amp;lt;name.jar&amp;gt; has a default image name &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;  native-image -cp ... fully.qualified.MainClass has a default image name fully.qualified.mainclassNote that using ImageName does not prevent the user to override the name later via command line. For example, if foo.bar contains ImageName=foo_app,  native-image -jar foo.bar generates the image foo_app but  native-image -jar foo.bar application generates the image application.Order of Arguments EvaluationThe arguments passed to native-image are evaluated left-to-right. This alsoextends to arguments that get passed indirectly via META-INF/native-imagebased native-image configuration. Suppose you have a jar file that containsnative-image.properties with Args = -H:Optimize=0. Then by using the-H:Optimize=2 option after -cp &amp;lt;jar-file&amp;gt; you can override the setting thatcomes from the jar file.Specifying Default Options for Native ImageIf there is a need to pass some options for every image build unconditionally, forexample, to always generate an image in verbose mode (--verbose), we canmake use of the NATIVE_IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.If it is set to a Java properties file, the Native Image builder will use thedefault setting defined in there on each invocation. We have to write aconfiguration file and exportNATIVE_IMAGE_CONFIG_FILE=$HOME/.native-image/default.properties in~/.bash_profile. Every time native-image gets used, it will implicitly usethe arguments specified as NativeImageArgs, plus the arguments specified on thecommand line. Here is an example of a configuration file, saved as~/.native-image/default.properties:NativeImageArgs = --configurations-path /home/user/custom-image-configs                   -O1Runtime vs Build Time InitializationBuilding your application into a native image allows you to decide which partsof your application should be run at image build time and which parts have torun at image runtime.Since GraalVM 19.0 all class-initialization code (static initializers and staticfield initialization) of the application you build an image for will be executedat image runtime by default. Sometimes it is beneficial to allow classinitialization code to get executed at image build time for faster startup (e.g.if some static fields get initialized to runtime independent data). This can becontrolled with the following native-image options:  --initialize-at-build-time=&amp;lt;comma-separated list of packages and classes&amp;gt;  --initialize-at-run-time=&amp;lt;comma-separated list of packages and classes&amp;gt;In addition to that we allow arbitrary computations at built time that can be put into ImageSingletons that areaccessible at image runtime. For more information please have a look at Native Image configuration examples.To learn more on the topic, continue reading on Application Initialization at Build Time.Integration with MavenTo simplify the generation of native images, GraalVM Native Image now works outof Maven with the Native Image Maven Plugin.As demonstrated in the Native Image configuration examples, one can build a native image directly with Mavenusing the mvn package command without running the native-image tool as aseparate step. It is sufficient to add native-image-maven-plugin into the&amp;lt;plugins&amp;gt; section of the pom.xml file:&amp;lt;plugin&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.nativeimage&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;native-image-maven-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;executions&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;execution&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;goals&amp;gt;                &amp;lt;goal&amp;gt;native-image&amp;lt;/goal&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;/goals&amp;gt;            &amp;lt;phase&amp;gt;package&amp;lt;/phase&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;/execution&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/executions&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;skip&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/skip&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;imageName&amp;gt;example&amp;lt;/imageName&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;            --no-fallback        &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/plugin&amp;gt;and the org.graalvm.sdk library dependency in the &amp;lt;dependencies&amp;gt; list:&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.sdk&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;graal-sdk&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${graalvm.version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;The plugin figures out what jar files it needs to pass to the native image andwhat the executable main class should be. If the heuristics fails with the nomain manifest attribute, in target/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.jar error, the main class should bespecified in the &amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; node of the plugin (see Plugin Customizationsection). When mvn package completes, an executable, generated in the targetdirectory of the project, is ready for use.Note: As of the GraalVM version 19.3, the Maven &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt; for the GraalVM NativeImage related artifacts, including the plugin, changes fromcom.oracle.substratevm to org.graalvm.nativeimage(&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.graalvm.nativeimage&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;).Plugin CustomizationWhen using GraalVM Enterprise Edition as the JAVA_HOMEenvironment, the plugin builds a native image with enterprise features enabled, e.g., an executable will automatically be built with compressed referencesand other optimizations enabled.It is also possible to customize native-image-maven-plugin within a&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt; node. The following configurations are available.  Configuration parameter &amp;lt;mainClass&amp;gt;. If the execution fails with the no main manifest attribute, in target/&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;.jar error, the main class should be specified. By default the plugin consults several locations in the  pom.xml file in the following order to determine what the main class of the image should be:          &amp;lt;maven-shade-plugin&amp;gt; &amp;lt;transformers&amp;gt; &amp;lt;transformer&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mainClass&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;maven-assembly-plugin&amp;gt; &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt; &amp;lt;manifest&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mainClass&amp;gt;      &amp;lt;maven-jar-plugin&amp;gt; &amp;lt;archive&amp;gt; &amp;lt;manifest&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mainClass&amp;gt;        Configuration parameter &amp;lt;imageName&amp;gt;. If an image filename is not set explicitly, use parameter &amp;lt;imageName&amp;gt; to provide a custom filename for the image.  Configuration parameter &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;. If you want to pass additional options for the image building, use the &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt; parameter the definition of the plugin. For example, to build a native image with assertions enabled that uses com.test.classname as a main class, add:&amp;lt;configuration&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;imageName&amp;gt;executable-name&amp;lt;/imageName&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;mainClass&amp;gt;com.test.classname&amp;lt;/mainClass&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;buildArgs&amp;gt;        --no-fallback    &amp;lt;/buildArgs&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;skip&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/skip&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;Memory Management ConfigurationOne can explicitly specify the allowed amount of memory when running a native image.-Xmn - to set the size of the young generation (the amount of memory that can be allocated without triggering a GC). The value is specified in bytes, suffix k, m, or g can be used for scaling, e.g., -Xmn16M, default 256M.-Xmx - maximum heap size in bytes. Note that this is not the maximum amount of consumed memory, because during GC the system can request more temporary memory, for example -Xmx16M, default unlimited.-Xms - minimum heap size in bytes. The value is specified in bytes, suffix k, m, or g can be used for scaling. Heap space that is unused will be retained for future heap usage, rather than being returned to the operating system.In addition, it is possible to fine-tune maximum memory to be used by an image. Set the percent value of physicalmemory using the -R:MaximumHeapSizePercent=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; option. For moreinformation, unfold the native-image --expert-options-all list and search for-R:MaximumHeapSizePercent=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;,-R:MaximumYoungGenerationSizePercent=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;,-H:AllocationBeforePhysicalMemorySize=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; and other related options.As of version 20.1.0 option -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=... was added to allowcontrolling the maximum size of direct buffer allocations.Low Latency Garbage CollectionWhen using GraalVM Enterprise you can enable the experimental option to use alower latency garbage collection implementation. A lower latency GC shouldimprove the performance of the native image applications by reducing thestop-the-world pauses.To enable it use the -H:+UseLowLatencyGC option when building a native image.Currently the lower latency GC works on Linux in the AMD64 builds. One canconfigure the default runtime heap size at image build time, e.g.,-R:MinHeapSize=256m -R:MaxHeapSize=2g -R:MaxNewSize=128m.You can use -XX:+PrintGC, -XX:+VerboseGC to get some information about garbage collections.How to Determine What Version of GraalVM an Image Is Generated With?Assuming you have a Java class file EmptyHello.class containing an empty main methodand have generated an empty shared object emptyhello with GraalVM Native Image Generator utility of it:$ native-image -cp hello EmptyHelloBuild on Server(pid: 11228, port: 41223)[emptyhello:11228]    classlist:     149.59 ms...If you do not know what GraalVM distribution is set to the PATH environmentvariable, how to determine if a native image was compiled with Community orEnterprise Edition? Run this command:$ strings emptyhello | grep com.oracle.svm.core.VMThe expected output should match the following:com.oracle.svm.core.VM GraalVM 20.1.0 CENote:Python source code or LLVM bitcode interpreted or compiled with GraalVMCommunity Edition will not have the same security characteristics as the samecode interpreted or compiled using GraalVM Enterprise Edition. There is aGraalVM string embedded in each image that allows to figure out the version andvariant of the base (Community or Enterprise) used to build an image.The following command will query that information from an image:strings &amp;lt;path to native-image exe or shared object&amp;gt; | grep com.oracle.svm.core.VMProfile-guided OptimizationsFor additional performance gain and higher throughput in GraalVMahead-of-time (AOT) mode, make use of profile-guided optimizations (PGO). WithPGO, you can collect the profiling data in advance and then feed it to theGraalVM native-image utility, which will use this information to optimize theperformance of the resulting binary.Note: Profile-guided optimizations (PGO) is a GraalVM Enterprise feature.In GraalVM versions prior to 19.2.0, a commonly used technique to mitigate themissing just-in-time (JIT) optimization is to gather the execution profiles at one runand then use them to optimize subsequent compilation(s). In other words, oneneeds to create a native image with the --pgo-instrument option to collect theprofile information. The --pgo-instrument builds an instrumented native imagewith profile-guided optimization data collected of AOT compiled codein the default.iprof file, if nothing else is specified. Then you run anexample program, saving the result in default.iprof. Finally, you create asecond native image with --pgo profile.iprof flag that should be significantlyfaster.Starting from 19.2.0, you can collect profiles while running yourapplication in JIT mode and then use this information to generatea highly-optimized native binary. This maximizes the performance even more.  Run a java program in JIT mode with a -Dgraal.PGOInstrument flag to gather the profiling information:    $ java -Dgraal.PGOInstrument=myclass.iprof MyClass    Use the collected data to generate a native image:    $ native-image --pgo=myclass.iprof MyClass    Run the resulting binary:    $ ./myclass  AOT Compilation LimitationsThere is a small portion of Java features are not susceptible to ahead-of-timecompilation, and will therefore miss out on the performance advantages. To beable to build a highly optimized native executable, we run an aggressive staticanalysis that requires a closed-world assumption, which means that all classesand all bytecodes that are reachable at runtime must be known at build time.Therefore, it is not possible to load new data that have not been availableduring ahead-of-time compilation. A more comprehensive list of restrictions can be found in the Native Image Java Limitations document.Tracing AgentTo overcome some restrictions of GraalVM Native Image and to simplify theconfiguration process, we implemented a tracing agent which records the behaviorof a Java application running on GraalVM or any other compatible JVM thatsupports Java VM Tool Interface (JVMTI). The tracing agent is supported in bothGraalVM Enterprise and Community Editions.Note: The tracing agent is part of the GraalVM Native Image component, which must be installed first.The tracing agent helps to deal with such features as Reflection, Java Native Interface, Class Path Resources, and Dynamic Proxy in the GraalVM environment. It is applicable when the static analysis cannot automatically determine what to put into a native image and undetected usages of these dynamic features need to be provided to the generation process in the form of configuration files. The tracing agent observes the application behavior and builds configuration files when running on the Java HotSpot VM, thus it can be enabled on the command line with the java command:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=/path/to/config-dir/ ...Please note that -agentlib must be specified before a -jar option or a classname or any application parameters in the java command line.During execution, the agent interfaces with the JVM to intercept all callsthat look up classes, methods, fields, resources or request proxy accesses. Theagent then generates the jni-config.json, reflect-config.json,proxy-config.json and resource-config.json in the specified outputdirectory. The generated files are stand-alone configuration files in JSONformat which contain all intercepted dynamic accesses.The generated configuration files can later be supplied to the native-image toolby placing them in a META-INF/native-image/ directory on the class path, forexample, in a JAR file. Not all of those files must be present. When multiplefiles with the same name are found, all of them are included.Read more about advanced usage of the tracing agent in Assisted Configuration of Native Image Builds document.Java Reflection SupportFurther below we will focus on GraalVM Native Image support of Java Reflection API.Java Reflection provides the ability to inspect and modify applications runtimebehavior. It allows to inspect a class or an interface, get its methods andfields information, invoke a method, and even create an object of a class atruntime. The Reflection API classes are part of the java.lang.reflect package.For GraalVM Native Image to handle the Reflection API, in some cases, a reflectionconfiguration has to be provided at image build time. Within aclosed-world assumption approach, an aggressive static analysis can see mostclasses, methods and fields with certainty because they are used directly.However, when the code accesses program elements by name via reflection, theanalysis cannot always determine ahead-of-time what program elements it refersto, and the user’s assistance is then needed to make these elements accessibleat runtime. For example, the analysis can discover all dynamic usages of theClass.forName(&quot;java.lang.String&quot;).getMethod(&quot;hashCode&quot;).invoke(&quot;Hello!&quot;);sequence because only constants are used, but inString.class.getMethod(&quot;hashCode&quot;.replace(&#39;K&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)).invoke(&quot;Hello!&quot;); itcannot. Where the static analysis fails to access the program elementsreflectively, they must be specified in a configuration file via the option-H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=. For more details, read our documentation on reflection support.In the given case, the tracing agent can simplify the configuration process andwrite a reflection configuration file by tracing all reflective lookupoperations on the Java HotSpot VM. The traced operations are Class.forName, Class.getMethod, and Class.getField.For demonstration purposes, save the following code as ReflectionExample.java file:import java.lang.reflect.Method;class StringReverser {    static String reverse(String input) {        return new StringBuilder(input).reverse().toString();    }}class StringCapitalizer {    static String capitalize(String input) {        return input.toUpperCase();    }}public class ReflectionExample {    public static void main(String[] args) throws ReflectiveOperationException {        String className = args[0];        String methodName = args[1];        String input = args[2];        Class&amp;lt;?&amp;gt; clazz = Class.forName(className);        Method method = clazz.getDeclaredMethod(methodName, String.class);        Object result = method.invoke(null, input);        System.out.println(result);    }}This is a simple Java program where non-constant strings for accessing programelements by name must come as external inputs. The main method invokes a methodof a particular class (Class.forName) whose names are passed as command linearguments. Providing any other class or method name on the command line leads toan exception.Having compiled the example, invoke each method:$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac ReflectionExample.java$JAVA_HOME/bin/java ReflectionExample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;olleh$JAVA_HOME/bin/java ReflectionExample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;HELLONow we are going to build a native image as regularly, without a reflection configuration file and run a resulting image:$JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image ReflectionExampleBuild on Server(pid: 59625, port: 58819)[reflectionexample:59625]    classlist:     467.66 ms...Note: Image &#39;reflectionexample&#39; is a fallback image that requires a JDK for execution (use --no-fallback to suppress fallback image generation).$ ./reflectionexampleThe reflectionexample binary is just a launcher for the Java HotSpot VM, a “fallbackimage” as stated in the warning message. To generate a native image withreflective lookup operations, we will apply the tracing agent to write aconfiguration file to be later feed into the native image generation togetherwith a --no-fallback option.  Create a directory META-INF/native-image in the working directory:    mkdir -p META-INF/native-image    Enable the agent and pass necessary command line arguments:    $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=META-INF/native-image ReflectionExample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;    This command creates a reflection-config.json file which makes the StringReverser class and the reverse() method accessible via reflection. The jni-config.json, proxy-config.json ,and resource-config.json configuration files are written in that directory too.    Build a native image:    $JAVA_HOME/bin/native-image --no-fallback ReflectionExample    The native image generator automatically picks up configuration files inMETA-INF/native-image directory or subdirectories. However, it is recommendedto have META-INF/native-image location on the class path, either via a JARfile or via the -cp flag. It will help to avoid confusion for IDE users where adirectory structure is defined by the tool.    Test the methods, but remember that we have not run the tracing agent twice to create a configurationthat supports both:    $ ./reflectionexample StringReverser reverse &quot;hello&quot;olleh$ ./reflectionexample  StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: StringCapitalizer at com.oracle.svm.core.hub.ClassForNameSupport.forName(ClassForNameSupport.java:60) at java.lang.Class.forName(DynamicHub.java:1161) at ReflectionExample.main(ReflectionExample.java:21)  Neither the tracing agent nor native images generator cannot automatically checkif the provided configuration files are complete. The agent only observes andrecords which values are accessed through reflection so that the same accessesare possible in a native image. You can either manually edit thereflection-config.json file, or re-run the tracing agent to transform theexisting configuration file, or extend it by using config-merge-dir option:$JAVA_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-merge-dir=META-INF/native-image ReflectionExample StringCapitalizer capitalize &quot;hello&quot;Note, the different option config-merge-dir instructs the agent to extend theexisting configuration files instead of overwriting them. After re-building thenative image, the StringCapitalizer class and the capitalize method will beaccessible too.Generating Heap DumpsGraalVM also supports monitoring and generating heap dumps of the Native Image processes.Note: This functionality is available in the Enterprise Edition of GraalVM.To find out more about generating heap dumps of the native image processes,refer to the step-by-step documentation.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhen does it make sense to run in a Native Image instead of the JVM?  When startup time, memory footprint and packaging size are important.  When you want to embed Java code with existing C/C++ applications.What tools work with Native Image: debugger, profilers? How to use them?  The community version does not support DWARF information. The enterprise version supports all native tools that rely on DWARF information, like debuggers (GNU Project Debugger) and profilers (VTune).",

                    "content": "Chrome DebuggerGraalVM supports debugging of guest language applications and provides abuilt-in implementation ofthe Chrome DevTools Protocol.This allows you to attach compatible debuggers such asChrome Developer Toolsto GraalVM.To debug guest language applications, pass the --inspect option to thecommand-line launcher, as in the followingexample with a Node.js hello world program:var http = require(&#39;http&#39;);var server = http.createServer(function (request, response) {  response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/plain&quot;});  response.end(&quot;Hello World!n&quot;);});server.listen(8000);console.log(&quot;Server running at http://localhost:8000/&quot;);  Save this program as HelloWorld.js and then run:$ node --inspect --jvm HelloWorld.jsDebugger listening on port 9229.To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:    chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=127.0.1.1:9229/76fcb6dd-35267eb09c3Server running at http://localhost:8000/      Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser to launch the node application.        Open the chrome-devtools:... link in a separate Chrome browser tab.        Navigate to the HelloWorld.js file and submit a breakpoint at line 4.        Refresh the node.js app and you can see the breakpoint hit.  You can inspect the stack, variables, evaluate variables and selected expressionsin a tooltip, and so on. By hovering a mouse over the response variable, forinstance, you can inspect its properties as can be seen in the screenshot below:Consult theJavaScript Debugging Referencefor details on Chrome DevTools debugging features.This debugging process applies to all guest languages that GraalVM supports.Other languages such as R and Ruby can be debugged as easily as JavaScript,including stepping through language boundaries during guest languageinteroperability.Inspect OptionsNode LauncherThe node.js implementation that GraalVM provides accepts the same options asnode.js built on the V8 JavaScript engine, such as:--inspect[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;]Enables the inspector agent and listens on port 9229 by default. To listen on adifferent port, specify the optional port number.--inspect-brk[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;]Enables the inspector agent and suspends on the first line of the applicationcode. Listens on port 9229 by default, to listen on a different port, specifythe optional port number. This applies to the node launcher only.Other Language LaunchersOther guest language launchers such as js, python, Rscript, ruby, lli and polyglotaccept the --inspect[=[host:]&amp;lt;port number&amp;gt;] option, but suspend on the first line ofthe application code by default.--inspect.Suspend=(true|false)Disables the initial suspension if you specify --inspect.Suspend=false.Additional Common Inspect OptionsAll launchers accept also following additional options:--inspect.Path=&amp;lt;path&amp;gt;Allows to specify a custom path that generates the connection URL. Do note that any website opened in your browser that has knowledge of the URL can connect to the debugger. A predictable path can thus be abused by a malicious website to execute arbitrary code on your computer, even if you are behind a firewall. Therefore the path is randomly generated by default.--inspect.SourcePath=&amp;lt;source path&amp;gt;This option specifies a list of directories or ZIP/JAR files representing the source path. When the inspected application contains relative references to source files, their content is loaded from locations resolved with respect to this source path. It is useful during LLVM debugging, for instance.The paths are delimited by : on UNIX systems and by ; on MS Windows.--inspect.Secure=(true|false)When true, use TLS/SSL to secure the debugging protocol. Besides changing the WS(web socket) protocol to WSS, the HTTP endpoint that serves metadata about the debuggeeis also changed to HTTPS. This is not compatible e.g., withchrome://inspect page, which is not able to provide the debuggeeinformation and launch the debugger then. Launch debugging via the printed WSS URL directly.Use the standard javax.net.ssl.* system options to provide information aboutkeystore with the TLS/SSL encryption keys, or following options:  --inspect.KeyStore keystore file path,  --inspect.KeyStoreType keystore file type (defaults to JKS),  --inspect.KeyStorePassword keystore password,  --inspect.KeyPassword password for recovering keys, if it’s different from the keystore password.--inspect.WaitAttached=(true|false)When true, no guest language source code is executed until the inspector clientis attached. Unlike --inspect.Suspend=true, the execution is resumed rightafter the client is attached. That assures that no execution is missed by theinspector client. It is false by default.Advanced Debug OptionsFollowing options are for language experts and language developers:--inspect.Initialization=(true|false)When true, inspect the language initialization phase. When initial suspension isactive, suspends at the beginning of language initialization and not necessarilyat the beginning of the application code. It’s false by default.--inspect.Internal=(true|false)When true, internal sources are inspected as well. Internal sources may providelanguage implementation details. It’s false by default.Programmatic Launch of Inspector BackendEmbedders can provide the appropriate inspector options to the Engine/Contextto launch the inspector backend. The following code snippet provides an example ofa possible launch:String port = &quot;4242&quot;;String path = java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString();String remoteConnect = &quot;true&quot;;Context context = Context.newBuilder(&quot;js&quot;)            .option(&quot;inspect&quot;, port)            .option(&quot;inspect.Path&quot;, path)            .option(&quot;inspect.Remote&quot;, remoteConnect)            .build();String hostAdress = &quot;localhost&quot;;String url = String.format(            &quot;chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/js_app.html?ws=%s:%s/%s&quot;,            hostAdress, port, path);// Chrome Inspector client can be attached by opening the above url in Chrome",

                    "title": "Code Coverage",
                    "content": "Code Coverage Command Line ToolAs of version 19.3.0 GraalVM provides a Code coverage command line toolthat lets record and analyze the source code coverage of a particular executionof code.Code coverage, as a percentage of source code lines, functions or statementscovered, is an important metric for understanding a particular source code execution, and is commonly associated with test quality (test coverage).Providing a visual coverage overview for individual lines of code showsthe developer which code paths are covered and which are not, giving insightinto the character of the execution which can, for example, inform furthertesting efforts.In this section, we use an example application to demonstrate the codecoverage capabilities that GraalVM offers. This example application defines agetPrime function that calculates the n-th prime using a basic prime numbercalculator based on the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. It also has a somewhat naive cache of the first 20 prime numbers.1.Copy the following code into a new file named primes.js:class AcceptFilter {    accept(n) {        return true    }}class DivisibleByFilter {    constructor(number, next) {        this.number = number;        this.next = next;    }    accept(n) {        var filter = this;        while (filter != null) {            if (n % filter.number === 0) {                    return false;            }            filter = filter.next;        }        return true;    }}class Primes {    constructor() {        this.number = 2;        this.filter = new AcceptFilter();    }    next() {        while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {            this.number++;        }        this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);        return this.number;    }}function calculatePrime(n) {    var primes = new Primes();    var primesArray = [];    for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {        primesArray.push(primes.next());    }    return primesArray[n-1];}function getPrime(n) {    var cache = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71];    var n = arguments[0];    if (n &amp;gt; cache.length) { return calculatePrime(n); }    return cache[n-1];}// TESTSconsole.assert(getPrime(1) == 2);console.assert(getPrime(10) == 29);Notice that the last couple of lines are assertions which we will, for illustration, treat as unit tests.2.Run js primes.js. The example application should print no output, since all the assertions pass. But how well do the assertions test the implementation?3.Run js primes.js --coverage to enable code coverage. The code coverage tool should print output for the example application as follows:$ js primes.js --coverage--------------------------------------------------------Code coverage histogram.Shows what percent of each element was covered during execution-------------------------------------------------------- Path               |  Statements |    Lines |    Roots-------------------------------------------------------- /path/to/primes.js |      20.69% |   26.67% |   22.22%--------------------------------------------------------The tracer prints a coverage histogram for each source file. We can see thatstatement coverage is roughly 20%, line coverage is 26% and root coverage (theterm root covers functions, methods, etc.) is 22.22%. This tells us that oursimple tests are not particularly good at exercising the source code.  Now wewill figure out what parts of the code are not covered.4.Run js primes.js --coverage --coverage.Output=detailed. Prepare for a somewhat verbose output.Specifying the output as detailed will print all the source code lines with acoverage annotation at the beginning. Due to potentially large output it isrecommended to combine this output mode with the --coverage.OutputFile optionwhich prints the output directly to a file. The output for our exampleapplication is as follows:$ js primes.js --coverage --coverage.Output=detailed--------------------------------------------------------Code coverage per line of code and what percent of each element was covered during execution (per source)  + indicates the line is covered during execution  - indicates the line is not covered during execution  p indicates the line is part of a statement that was incidentally covered during execution    e.g. a not-taken branch of a covered if statement-------------------------------------------------------- Path               |  Statements |    Lines |    Roots /path/to/primes.js |      20.69% |   26.67% |   22.22%  class AcceptFilter {      accept(n) {-         return true      }  }  class DivisibleByFilter {      constructor(number, next) {-         this.number = number;-         this.next = next;      }      accept(n) {-         var filter = this;-         while (filter != null) {-             if (n % filter.number === 0) {-                     return false;-             }-             filter = filter.next;          }-         return true;      }  }  class Primes {      constructor() {-         this.number = 2;-         this.filter = new AcceptFilter();      }      next() {-         while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {-             this.number++;          }-         this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);-         return this.number;      }  }  function calculatePrime(n) {-     var primes = new Primes();-     var primesArray = [];-     for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; n; i++) {-         primesArray.push(primes.next());      }-     return primesArray[n-1];  }  function getPrime(n) {+     var cache = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71];+     var n = arguments[0];p     if (n &amp;gt; cache.length) { return calculatePrime(n); }+     return cache[n-1];  }  // TESTS+ console.assert(getPrime(1) == 2);+ console.assert(getPrime(10) == 29);--------------------------------------------------------As the legend at the beginning of the output explains, lines that are covered bythe execution are preceded with a +, lines not covered by the execution arepreceded with a -. Lines that are covered partially (e.g., when an ifstatement is covered, but only one branch is taken, we consider the other benchto be incidentally covered) are preceded with p.Looking at the output we can see that the calculatePrime function and all itscalls are never executed. Looking again at the assertions and the getPrimefunction it becomes clear that our tests always hit the cache, thus most of thecode is never executed. Let’s improve on that.5.Add console.assert(getPrime(30) == 113); to the end of the primes.js fileand run js primes.js --coverage. Since the new assertion added callsgetPrime with 30 (our cache only has 20 entries) our coverage will look likethis:$ js primes.js --coverage-------------------------------------------------------Code coverage histogram.

Runningwith --coverage.Output=lcov produces output in the commonly usedlcov format which is used by multiple tools(e.g., genhtml) to display coverage data. Take a look at the next example thatshows how to visualise coverage of a Node.js app with Visual Studio Code.1.Copy the following code into a new file named nodeapp.js:const express = require(&#39;express&#39;)const app = express()const port = 3000app.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;Hello World!&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/neverCalled&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  res.send(&#39;You should not be here&#39;)})app.get(&#39;/shutdown&#39;, (req, res) =&amp;gt; {  process.exit();})app.listen(port, () =&amp;gt; console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}!`))2.Install the express module dependency: npm install express.3.Launch Visual Studio Code and install a code coverage plugin that supports lcov.We use Code Coverage Highlighter for this example, but other plugins should work similarly.4.Run the nodeapp.js file with coverage enabled and configured:node --coverage --coverage.Output=lcov --coverage.OutputFile=coverage/lcov.info nodeapp.jsNote that the Code Coverage Highlighter plugin looks for the lcov.info file inthe coverage directory by default, so we direct the output of the codecoverage tool there.5.Visit localhost:3000/ in your browser, then visit localhost:3000/shutdown to close the app.6.Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder containing the nodeapp.js fileand coverage directory and you should be greeted with an image similar to the following.If you wish to integrate the data gathered by the GraalVM code coverage toolwith your own visualisation, the --coverage.Output=json option results inthe output being a JSON file with the raw data gathered by the tracker.",

                    "content": "CompatibilityTruffleRuby aims to be fully compatible with the standard implementation ofRuby, MRI, version 2.6.5.Any incompatibility with MRI is considered a bug, except for rare cases detailed below.If you find an incompatibility with MRI, please report it to us.Our policy is to match the behaviour of MRI, except where we do not know how todo so with good performance for typical Ruby programs. Some features work butwill have very low performance whenever they are used and we advise againstusing them on TruffleRuby if you can. Some features are missing entirely and maynever be implemented. In a few limited cases, we are deliberately incompatiblewith MRI in order to provide a greater capability.In general, we are not looking to debate whether Ruby features are good, bad, orif we could design the language better. If we can support a feature, we will do.In the future, we aim to provide compatibility with extra functionality providedby JRuby, but at the moment we do not.IdentificationTruffleReport defines these constants for identification:  RUBY_ENGINE is &#39;truffleruby&#39;  RUBY_VERSION is the compatible MRI version  RUBY_REVISION is the compatible MRI version revision  RUBY_PATCHLEVEL is always zero  RUBY_RELEASE_DATE is the Git commit date  RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION is the GraalVM version, or 0.0- and the Git commit hash if your build is not part of a GraalVM release.Additionally, TruffleRuby defines:  TruffleRuby.revision which is the Git commit hashIn the C API, we define a preprocessor macro TRUFFLERUBY.Features Entirely MissingContinuations and callccContinuations and callcc are unlikely to ever be implemented in TruffleRuby,as their semantics fundamentally do not match the technology that we are using.ForkYou cannot fork the TruffleRuby interpreter. The feature is unlikely to everbe supported when running on the JVM but could be supported in the future inthe native configuration. The correct and portable way to test if fork isavailable is:Process.respond_to?(:fork)Standard librariesThe following standard libraries are unsupported.  continuation  dbm  gdbm  sdbm  debug (could be implemented in the future, use --inspect instead)  profile (could be implemented in the future, use --cpusampler instead)  profiler (could be implemented in the future, use --cpusampler instead)  io/console (partially implemented, could be implemented in the future)  io/wait (partially implemented, could be implemented in the future)  pty (could be implemented in the future)  ripper (has a no-op implementation, and could be implemented in the future)  win32  win32oleWe provide our own included implementation of the interface of the ffi gem,like JRuby and Rubinius. The implementation should be fairly complete and passesall the specs of the ffi gem except for some rarely-used corner cases.Safe levels$SAFE and Thread#safe_level are 0 and no other levels are implemented.Trying to use level 1 will raise a SecurityError. Other levels will raiseArgumentError as in standard Ruby. See our security notes formore explanation on this.Internal MRI functionalityRubyVM is not intended for users and is not implemented.Features with Major DifferencesThreads run in parallelIn MRI, threads are scheduled concurrently but not in parallel. In TruffleRubythreads are scheduled in parallel. As in JRuby and Rubinius, you are responsiblefor correctly synchronising access to your own shared mutable data structures,and we will be responsible for correctly synchronising the state of theinterpreter.Threads detect interrupts at different pointsTruffleRuby threads may detect that they have been interrupted at differentpoints in the program to where it would on MRI. In general, TruffleRuby seemsto detect an interrupt sooner than MRI. JRuby and Rubinius are also differentto MRI, the behaviour isn’t documented in MRI, and it’s likely to changebetween MRI versions, so we would not recommend depending on interrupt pointsat all.Fibers do not have the same performance characteristics as in MRIMost use cases of fibers rely on them being easy and cheap to start up andhaving low memory overheads. In TruffleRuby we implement fibers using operatingsystem threads, so they have the same performance characteristics as Rubythreads. As with coroutines and continuations, a conventional implementationof fibers fundamentally isn’t compatible with the execution model we arecurrently using.Some classes marked as internal will be differentMRI provides some classes that are described in the documentation as being onlyavailable on MRI (C Ruby). We implement these classes if it’s practical to doso, but this isn’t always the case. For example RubyVM is not available.Features with Subtle DifferencesCommand line switches-y, --yydebug, --dump=, --debug-frozen-string-literal are ignored witha warning as they are unsupported development tools.Programs passed in -e arguments with magic-comments must have an encoding thatis UTF-8 or a subset of UTF-8, as the JVM has already decoded arguments by thetime we get them.--jit options and the jit feature are not supported because TruffleRubyuses Graal as a JIT.Time is limited to millisecond precisionRuby normally provides microsecond (millionths of a second) clock precision,but TruffleRuby is currently limited to millisecond (thousands of a second)precision. This applies to Time.now andProcess.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_REALTIME).Strings have a maximum bytesize of 231-1Ruby Strings are represented as a Java byte[]. The JVM enforces a maximumarray size of 231-1 (by storing the size in a 32-bit signed int),and therefore Ruby Strings cannot be longer than 231-1 bytes. Thatis, Strings must be smaller than 2GB. This is the same restriction as JRuby. Wecould try to workaround by using native strings, but this would be a largeeffort to support every Ruby String operation on native strings.Setting the process title doesn’t always workSetting the process title (via $0 or Process.setproctitle in Ruby) is doneas best-effort. It may not work, or the title you try to set may be truncated.Line numbers other than 1 work differentlyIn an eval where a custom line number can be specified, line numbers below 1are treated as 1, and line numbers above 1 are implemented by inserting blanklines in front of the source before parsing it.The erb standard library has been modified to not use negative line numbers.Polyglot standard IO streamsIf you use standard IO streams provided by the Polyglot engine, via theexperimental --polyglot-stdio option, reads and writes to file descriptors 1,2 and 3 will be redirected to these streams. That means that other IOoperations on these file descriptors, such as isatty may not be relevant forwhere these streams actually end up, and operations like dup may lose theconnection to the polyglot stream. For example, if you $stdout.reopen, assome logging frameworks do, you will get the native standard-out, not thepolyglot out.Also, IO buffer drains, writes on IO objects with sync set, andwrite_nonblock, will not retry the write on EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, as thestreams do not provide a way to detect this.Error messagesError message strings will sometimes differ from MRI, as these are not generallycovered by the Ruby Specification suite or tests.SignalsThe set of signals that TruffleRuby can handle is different from MRI. Whenlaunched as a GraalVM Native Image, TruffleRuby allows trapping all the samesignals that MRI does, as well as a few that MRI doesn’t. The only signalsthat can’t be trapped are KILL, STOP, and VTALRM. Consequently, anysignal handling code that runs on MRI can run on TruffleRuby without modificationin the GraalVM Native Image.However, when run on the JVM, TruffleRuby is unable to trap USR1 or QUIT,as these are reserved by the JVM itself. Any code that relies on being able totrap those signals will need to fallover to another available signal. Additionally,FPE, ILL, KILL, SEGV, STOP, and VTALRM cannot be trapped, but thesesignals are also unavailable on MRI.When TruffleRuby is run as part of a polyglot application, any signals that arehandled by another language become unavailable for TruffleRuby to trap.Features with Very Low PerformanceObjectSpaceUsing most methods on ObjectSpace will temporarily lower the performance ofyour program. Using them in test cases and other similar ‘offline’ operations isfine, but you probably don’t want to use them in the inner loop of yourproduction application.set_trace_funcUsing set_trace_func will temporarily lower the performance of your program.As with ObjectSpace, we would recommend that you do not use this in the innerloop of your production application.BacktracesThrowing exceptions, and other operations which need to create a backtrace, areslower than on MRI. This is because we have to undo optimizations that we haveapplied to run your Ruby code fast in order to recreate the backtrace entries.We wouldn’t recommend using exceptions for control flow on any implementation ofRuby anyway.To help alleviate this problem in some cases backtraces are automaticallydisabled where we dynamically detect that they probably won’t be used. See theexperimental --backtraces-omit-unused option.C Extension CompatibilityIdentifiers may be macros or functionsIdentifiers which are normally macros may be functions, functions may be macros,and global variables may be macros. This may cause problems where they are usedin a context which relies on a particular implementation (e.g., taking theaddress of it, assigning to a function pointer variable and using defined() tocheck if a macro exists). These issues should all be considered bugs and befixed, please report these cases.rb_scan_argsrb_scan_args only supports up to 10 pointers.rb_funcallrb_funcall only supports up to 15 arguments.mark functions of RDATA and RTYPEDDATAThe mark functions of RDATA and RTYPEDDATA are not called duringgarbage collection but periodically. We cache informationabout objects as they are assigned to structs, and periodically runall mark functions when the cache has become full to represent thoseobject relationships in a way that the our garbage collector willunderstand. The process should behave identically to MRI.Compatibility with JRubyRuby to Java interopTruffleRuby does not support the same interop to Java interface as JRuby does.We provide an alternate polyglot API for interoperating withmultiple languages, including Java, instead.Java to Ruby interopCalling Ruby code from Java is supported by theGraalVM polyglot API.Java extensionsUse Java extensions written for JRuby is not supported. We could apply the sametechniques as we have developed to run C extensions to this problem, but it’snot clear if this will ever be a priority.Compatibility with RubiniusWe do not have any plans at the moment to provide support for Rubinius’extensions to Ruby.Features Not Yet Supported in Native ConfigurationRunning TruffleRuby in the native configuration is mostly the same as runningon the JVM. There are differences in resource management, as both VMs usedifferent garbage collectors. But, functionality-wise, they are essentially onpar with one another.Java interoperability works in the native configuration but requires more setup.First, only for classes loaded in the image can be accessed.You can add more classes by compiling a native image including TruffleRuby.See https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/embed/#build-native-images-from-polyglot-applications for details.Spec Completeness‘How many specs are there?’ is not a question with an easy precise answer. Thenumber of specs varies for different versions of the Ruby language, differentplatforms, different versions of the specs, and different configurations ofthe specs. The specs for the standard library and C extension API are alsovery uneven and they so can give misleading results.For the command line interface, the language, and the core library specs,which covers the bulk of what TruffleRuby reimplements, this is how many specexamples TruffleRuby runs successfully compared to our compatible version ofMRI running the version of specs from TruffleRuby:  Command line 112 / 136, 82%  Language 2270 / 2332, 97%  Core library 19453 / 20644, 94%",

We run a comprehensive set of language specification testson each push to any of the GraalVM language repositories. Sometimes those test suites areincomplete, in which case we work with third parties to improve the overall ecosystem.We also run regular tests against a subset of popular packages for each of the supportedGraalVM languages. If you are interested in checking if your package is supported, use oneof the two tools below. Specify the name of the module or package you are interested in, or drop in your package.json, Gemfile.lock, or other files containing the list of your dependencies.Note that all the processing is done on the client-side in the browser, no information is sent to any servers.We run tests on the modules from their respective repositories: NPM for node modules, RubyGems for Ruby gems, etc. We try to download the module and run its tests. If the tests pass, the compatibility checker will report the amount of passed tests for the module, for example “100.00% tests pass”. If the tests are not using the testing framework we support running, you will see the “installs but not yet tested” message. Please use the compatibility checker as the initial tool to check the compatibility and assess it further yourself. In general, unless the tests clearly fail, there is a good chance the module will run on GraalVM.            Quickly check if an NPM module, Ruby gem, or R  package is compatible with GraalVM.                                                            &amp;times;                        Check!

We currently test:            More than 95,000 NPM modules based on mocha, jest, ava, tape, and other test frameworks.      The top 1,000 most popular Ruby gems.

Only a large community can make this project a strong languagevirtualization technology.There are two common ways to collaborate:  By submitting GitHub issues for bug reports, questions, or requests for enhancements. Note, that a security vulnerability should be reported to secalert_us@oracle.com.  By creating GitHub pull requests.How to Become a GraalVM Contributor?Further below are some tips for contributing to GraalVM Community Edition andits projects, hosted in the Oracle organization on GitHub. We expect a contributor to abide bythe Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.Overall, there are three stages:I. Create a Pull RequestIf you believe your contribution is valuable for others, create a pull request (PR). The common process is forking arepository, submitting a change and creating a PR. When creating a PR, pleasemake sure to include a clear description of the intention of the change, unlessthe change is self-explanatory e.g., a version update. Describe why (1) thechange or feature is needed, (2) how it is implemented, and optionally (3) whatfurther implications it may have. You can either use the PR request descriptionfield or the commit message. It is recommended to address one feature or changeper PR request.Once you have created a pull request, the Travis CI service will run some sanity checks on your change. Be sure to address any obvious issues caught by these checks (e.g., formatting violation)but keep in mind that test failures may not be directly related to your changes(no gate is perfect due to infrastructure issues and transient test failures).II. Sign the Oracle Contributor AgreementTo allow your pull request to be accepted, you will need to sign the Oracle Contributor Agreement (OCA). Once your name or organization shows up in the OCA signatory list, we can add you to the database used to check that pull requestauthors are covered under the OCA. If there appears to be a delay in your entryshowing up in the signatories list, please send an email tooracle-ca_us@oracle.com. If your entry is inthe signatories list but the bot leaves a message on your pull request that youhave not signed the OCA, leave a comment on the  pull request stating that youare now covered by the OCA. The bot operates from a database separate from theOCA signatories list (since the latter does not necessarily include emaildetails) and must be manually updated.III. Review and MergeAn Oracle employee reviews the proposed change and once the pull request is in amergeable state, takes responsibility for merging it to the master branch. Toensure extra diligence in terms of verifying externally contributed code meetsthese requirements, we have an inbound-check-bot.What to Expect When Submitting a Pull Request?There are many directions to explore from smaller changes like bug fixes orimprovements to the API documentation to larger changes that can either speed up theexecution, or give better control over the system.We look forward to extend the GraalVM ecosystem by implementing new languagessupport with the Truffle framework, providingbetter tooling for polyglot programming, or proposing new embedding scenarios.The continuous efforts are directed to the machine learning for optimizingcompiler configurations. Contributors are welcomed to join the developmentof a fully meta-circular Java runtime written in Java. We keep on investigatingtechniques for more efficient memory usage and pursue improving performance fordifferent workloads.To reach GraalVM developers for questions related to working with GraalVM sources, subscribe and post to graalvm-dev@oss.oracle.com.",

It’simportant to understand the different configurations of TruffleRuby, as each hasdifferent capabilities and performance characteristics. You should pick theexecution mode that is appropriate for your application.Native ConfigurationWhen distributed as part of GraalVM, TruffleRuby by default runs in the Nativeconfiguration. In this configuration, TruffleRuby is ahead-of-time compiled to astandalone native executable. This means that you don’t need a JVM installed onyour system to use it.The advantages are that it starts about as fast as MRI, it may use less memory,and it becomes fast in less time than the JVM configuration. The disadvantagesare that you can’t use Java tools like VisualVM, it is less convenient for Javainteroperability, and peak performance may be lower than on the JVM. You canselect the Native configuration by passing --native.When building from source, you’ll need to select the --native build configurationto be able to use the runtime native configuration.JVM ConfigurationTruffleRuby can also be used in the JVM configuration, where it runs as anormal Java application on the JVM. The advantages of the JVM configuration arethat you can use Java interoperability easily, and peak performance may behigher than the native configuration. The disadvantages are that it takes muchlonger to start and to get fast, and may use more memory. You can select theJVM configuration by passing --jvm.Selecting the Best ConfigurationIf you are running a short-running program you probably want the default,native, configuration. If you are running a long-running program and want thehighest possible performance you probably want the JVM configuration, by using--jvm.Getting the best startup time performanceTo get the best startup time performance in most cases you want to use thenative configuration, which is the default.Getting the lowest memory footprintTo get the lowest memory footprint you probably initially want to use the nativeconfiguration, but as you get a larger working set of objects you may find thatthe simpler garbage collector and current lack of compressed ordinary objectpointers (OOPS) actually increases your memory footprint and you’ll be betteroff with the JVM configuration using --jvm to reduce memory use.Getting the best peak performance from TruffleRubyTo get the best peak performance from TruffleRuby for longer-runningapplications we would in most cases recommend the JVM configuration with--jvm.However to reach this peak performance you need to warm-up TruffleRuby, as youdo with most heavily optimising virtual machines. This is done by running theapplication under load for a period of time. If you monitor the performance (bymeasuring operation time, or response time) you will see it reduce over time andthen probably stabilise.LoggingRuby application logging and warning works as in the standard implementation ofRuby.For logging of TruffleRuby internals, standard Java logging is used. The logginglevel can be set with --log.level=INFO, =FINEST, or so on.",

                    "content": "IntroductionThe GraalVM Polyglot API lets you embed and run code from guest languages in JVM-based host applications.Throughout this section, you learn how to create a host application in Java thatruns on GraalVM and directly calls a guest language. You can use the tabsbeneath each code example to choose between JavaScript, R, Ruby and Python.Ensure you set up GraalVM before you begin. SeeGet Started.Alternatively, you can have a look at the reference documentation in Javadoc:  The Polyglot Package allows you to configure and run polyglot applications.  The Proxy Package allows you to mimic guest language objects using proxies.  The IO Package allows you to customize the file system access of languages.Compile and Run a Polyglot ApplicationPolyglot applications run code written in any language implemented with the Truffle Language Implementation Framework.These languages are henceforth referenced as guests languages.Complete the steps in this section to create a sample polyglotapplication that runs on GraalVM and demonstrates programming languageinteroperability.1. Create a hello-polyglot project directory.2. In your project directory, add a HelloPolyglot.java file that includesthe following code:                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java {file}// BEGIN-SNIPPETimport org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;// END-SNIPPETpublic class hello_polyglot_js {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class HelloPolyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Java!&quot;);        try (Context context = Context.create()) {            context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello JavaScript!&#39;);&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET    public static void main(String[] args) {        HelloPolyglot.main(null);    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java {file}// BEGIN-SNIPPETimport org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;// END-SNIPPETpublic class hello_polyglot_R {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class HelloPolyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Java!&quot;);        try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                                   .allowAllAccess(true)                               .build()) {            context.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello R!&#39;);&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET    public static void main(String[] args) {        HelloPolyglot.main(null);    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java {file}// BEGIN-SNIPPETimport org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;// END-SNIPPETpublic class hello_polyglot_ruby {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class HelloPolyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Java!&quot;);        try (Context context = Context.create()) {            context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;puts &#39;Hello Ruby!&#39;&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET    public static void main(String[] args) {        HelloPolyglot.main(null);    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java {file}// BEGIN-SNIPPETimport org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;// END-SNIPPETpublic class hello_polyglot_python {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class HelloPolyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(&quot;Hello Java!&quot;);        try (Context context = Context.create()) {            context.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;print(&#39;Hello Python!&#39;)&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET    public static void main(String[] args) {        HelloPolyglot.main(null);    }}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  import org.graalvm.polyglot.* imports the base API for the Polyglot API.  import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.* imports the proxy classes of the Polyglot API, needed in later examples.  Context provides an execution environment for guest languages.R currently requires the allowAllAccess flag to be set to true to run the example.  eval evaluates the specified snippet of guest language code.  The try with resource statement initializes the Context and ensures that itis closed after use. Closing the context ensures that all resources includingpotential native resources are freed eagerly. Closing a context is optional butrecommended. Even if a context is not closed and no longer referenced it will befreed by the garbage collector automatically.3. Run javac HelloPolyglot.java to compile HelloPolyglot.java withGraalVM.4. Run java HelloPolyglot to run the application on GraalVM.You now have a polyglot application that consists of a Java host applicationand guest language code that run on GraalVM. You can use this application withother code examples to demonstrate more advanced capabilities of thePolyglot API.To use other code examples in this section, you simply need to do the following:1. Add the code snippet to the main method of HelloPolyglot.java.2. Compile and run your polyglot application.Define Guest Language Functions as Java ValuesPolyglot applications let you take values from one programming language anduse them with other languages.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to showhow the Polyglot API can return JavaScript, R, Ruby or Python functions asJava values.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_js {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;x =&amp;gt; x+1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_R {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;function(x) x + 1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_ruby {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;proc { |x| x + 1 }&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;} // END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class function_python {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value function = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;lambda x: x + 1&quot;);    assert function.canExecute();    int x = function.execute(41).asInt();    assert x == 42;} // END-SNIPPET    }}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  Value function is a Java value that refers to a function.  The eval call parses the script and returns the guest language function.  The first assertion checks that the value returned by the code snippet can beexecuted.  The execute call executes the function with the argument 41.  The asInt call converts the result to a Java int.  The second assertion verifies that the result was incremented by one as expected.Access Guest Languages Directly from JavaPolyglot applications can readily access most language types and are notlimited to functions. Host languages, such as Java, can directly access guestlanguage values embedded in the polyglot application.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to showhow the Polyglot API can access objects, numbers, strings, and arrays.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_js_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                     &quot;({ &quot;                   +                        &quot;id   : 42, &quot;       +                        &quot;text : &#39;42&#39;, &quot;     +                        &quot;arr  : [1,42,3] &quot;  +                    &quot;})&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();    int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;    String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);    Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_R_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;,                     &quot;list(&quot;                +                        &quot;id   = 42, &quot;      +                        &quot;text = &#39;42&#39;, &quot;    +                        &quot;arr  = c(1,42,3)&quot; +                    &quot;)&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_ruby_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;,                     &quot;o = Struct.new(:id, :text, :arr).new(&quot; +                        &quot;42, &quot;       +                        &quot;&#39;42&#39;, &quot;     +                        &quot;[1,42,3] &quot;  +                    &quot;)&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_python_from_java {    public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.create()) {    Value result = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;,                     &quot;type(&#39;obj&#39;, (object,), {&quot; +                        &quot;&#39;id&#39;  : 42, &quot;         +                        &quot;&#39;text&#39;: &#39;42&#39;, &quot;       +                        &quot;&#39;arr&#39; : [1,42,3]&quot;     +                    &quot;})()&quot;);    assert result.hasMembers();        int id = result.getMember(&quot;id&quot;).asInt();    assert id == 42;        String text = result.getMember(&quot;text&quot;).asString();    assert text.equals(&quot;42&quot;);        Value array = result.getMember(&quot;arr&quot;);    assert array.hasArrayElements();    assert array.getArraySize() == 3;    assert array.getArrayElement(1).asInt() == 42;}// END-SNIPPET    }}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  Value result is an Object that contains three members: a number named id,a string named text, and an array named arr.  The first assertion verifies that the return value can contain members, whichindicates that the value is an object-like structure.  The id variable is initialized by reading the member with the name id fromthe resulting object. The result is then converted to a Java intusing asInt().  The next assert verifies that result has a value of 42.  The text variable is initialized using the value of the member text, which is also converted to a Java String using asString().  The following assertion verifies the result value is equal to theJava String &quot;42&quot;.  Next the arr member that holds an array is read.  Arrays return true for hasArrayElements. R array instances can havemembers and array elements at the same time.  The next assertion verifies that the size of the array equals three. ThePolyglot API supports big arrays, so the array length is of type long.  Finally we verify that the array element at index 1 equals 42. Arrayindexing with polyglot values is always zero-based, even for languages such asR where indices start with one.Access Java from Guest LanguagesPolyglot applications offer bi-directional access between guest languages andhost languages. As a result, you can pass Java objects to guest languages.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show howguest languages can access primitive Java values, objects, arrays, andfunctional interfaces.To permit guest languages to access any public method or field of a Javaobject, set allowAllAccess(true) when the context is built. In this mode, the guestlanguage code must be fully trusted, as it can access other not explicitly exported Java methodsusing reflection. A later section describes how to run less trusted code with the Polyglot API.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import java.util.concurrent.Callable;import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class access_java_from_js {// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic static class MyClass {    public int               id    = 42;

The fields are initialized with 42, &quot;42&quot;, new int[]{1, 42, 3} andlambda () -&amp;gt; 42 that always returns an int value of 42.  The Java class MyClass is instantiated and exported with the name javaObjinto the polyglot scope, which allows the host and guest languages to exchangesymbols.  A guest language script is evaluated that imports the javaObj symbol andassigns it to the local variable which is also named javaObj. To avoidconflicts with variables, every value in the polyglot scope must be explicitlyimported and exported in the top-most scope of the language.  The next two lines verify the contents of the Java object by comparing itto the number 42 and the string &#39;42&#39;.  The third verification reads from the second array position and compares itto the number 42. Whether arrays are accessed using 0-based or 1-based indicesdepends on the guest language. Independently of the language, the Java arraystored in field arr is always accessed using translated 0-based indices. Forexample, in the R language, arrays are 1-based so the second array element isaccessible using index 2. In the JavaScript and Ruby languages, the secondarray element is at index 1. In all language examples, the Java array is readfrom using the same index 1.  The last line invokes the Java lambda that is contained in the field ret42and compares the result to the number value 42.  After the guest language script executes, validation takes place to ensurethat the script returns a boolean value of true as a result.Lookup Java Types from Guest LanguagesIn addition to passing Java objects to the guest language, it is possibleto allow the lookup of Java types in the guest language.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to show howguest languages lookup Java types and instantiate them.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_js {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,            &quot;var BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);&quot; +            &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_R {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;,            &quot;BigDecimal = java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;);n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal$valueOf(10)$pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_ruby {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;,            &quot;BigDecimal = Java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;)n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                                             // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;public class lookup_java_from_python {public static void main(String[] args) {// BEGIN-SNIPPETtry (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                           .allowAllAccess(true)                       .build()) {    java.math.BigDecimal v = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;,            &quot;import javan&quot; +            &quot;BigDecimal = java.type(&#39;java.math.BigDecimal&#39;)n&quot; +             &quot;BigDecimal.valueOf(10).pow(20)&quot;)        .asHostObject();    assert v.toString().equals(&quot;100000000000000000000&quot;);}// END-SNIPPET}}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  A new context is created with all access enabled (allowAllAccess(true)).  A new context is created with all access enabled (allowAllAccess(true)).  A guest language script is evaluated.  The script looks the Java type java.math.BigDecimal up and stores it in a variable named BigDecimal.  The static method BigDecimal.valueOf(long) is invoked to create newBigDecimals with value 10. In addition to looking up static Java methods, itis also possible to directly instantiate the returned Java type., e.g., inJavaScript using the new keyword.  The new decimal is used to invoke the pow instance method with 20 which calculates  10^20.  The result of the script is converted to a host object by calling asHostObject(). The return value is automatically cast to the BigDecimal type.  The result decimal string is asserted to equal to &quot;100000000000000000000&quot;.Computed Arrays Using Polyglot ProxiesThe Polyglot API includes polyglot proxy interfaces that let youcustomize Java interoperability by mimicking guest language types, such asobjects, arrays, native objects, or primitives.Use the code example in this section with your polyglot application to see howyou can implement arrays that compute their values lazily.Note: The Polyglot API supports polyglot proxies either on the JVM orin a native image executable.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;public class proxy_js {// BEGIN-SNIPPETstatic class ComputedArray implements ProxyArray {    public Object get(long index) {        return index * 2;    }    public void set(long index, Value value) {        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();    }    public long getSize() {        return Long.MAX_VALUE;    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.create()) {        ComputedArray arr = new ComputedArray();        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;arr&quot;, arr);        long result = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                    &quot;arr[1] + arr[1000000000]&quot;)                .asLong();        assert result == 2000000002L;    }}// END-SNIPPET}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.ProxyArray;public class proxy_R {// BEGIN-SNIPPETstatic class ComputedArray implements ProxyArray {    public Object get(long index) {        return index * 2;    }    public void set(long index, Value value) {        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();    }    public long getSize() {        return Long.MAX_VALUE;    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                               .allowAllAccess(true)                           .build()) {        ComputedArray arr = new ComputedArray();        context.getPolyglotBindings().putMember(&quot;arr&quot;, arr);        long result = context.eval(&quot;R&quot;,               &quot;arr &amp;lt;- import(&#39;arr&#39;);&quot; +               &quot;arr[2] + arr[1000000001]&quot;)           .asLong();        assert result == 2000000002L;    }}// END-SNIPPET}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.ProxyArray;public class proxy_ruby {// BEGIN-SNIPPETstatic class ComputedArray implements ProxyArray {    public Object get(long index) {        return index * 2;    }    public void set(long index, Value value) {        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();    }    public long getSize() {        return Long.MAX_VALUE;    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                               .allowAllAccess(true)                           .build()) {        ComputedArray arr = new ComputedArray();        context.getPolyglotBindings().putMember(&quot;arr&quot;, arr);        long result = context.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;,               &quot;arr = Polyglot.import(&#39;arr&#39;) n&quot; +               &quot;arr[1] + arr[1000000000]&quot;)           .asLong();        assert result == 2000000002L;    }}// END-SNIPPET}                                            // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.Value;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.ProxyArray;public class proxy_python {// BEGIN-SNIPPETstatic class ComputedArray implements ProxyArray {    public Object get(long index) {        return index * 2;    }    public void set(long index, Value value) {        throw new UnsupportedOperationException();    }    public long getSize() {        return Long.MAX_VALUE;    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                               .allowAllAccess(true)                           .build()) {        ComputedArray arr = new ComputedArray();        context.getPolyglotBindings().putMember(&quot;arr&quot;, arr);        long result = context.eval(&quot;python&quot;,               &quot;import polyglotn&quot; +               &quot;arr = polyglot.import_value(&#39;arr&#39;) n&quot; +               &quot;arr[1] + arr[1000000000]&quot;)           .asLong();        assert result == 2000000002L;    }}// END-SNIPPET}                JavaScript      R      Ruby      Python       In this code:  The Java class ComputedArray implements the proxy interface ProxyArray sothat guest languages treat instances of the Java class like arrays.  ComputedArray array overrides the method get and computes the valueusing an arithmetic expression.  The array proxy does not support write access. For this reason, it throwsan UnsupportedOperationException in the implementation of set.  The implementation for getSize returns Long.MAX_VALUE for its length.  The main method creates a new polyglot execution context.  A new instance of the ComputedArray class is then exported using the name arr.  The guest language script imports the arr symbol, which returns theexported proxy.  The second element and the 1000000000th element is accessed, summed up, andthen returned. Note that array indices from 1-based languages such as R areconverted to 0-based indices for proxy arrays.  The result of the language script is returned as a long value and verified.For more information about the polyglot proxy interfaces, see thePolyglot API JavaDoc.Access RestrictionsThe Polyglot API by default restricts access to certain critical functionality, such as file I/O.These restrictions can be lifted entirely by setting allowAllAccess to true.Important: Access restrictions are currently only supported with JavaScript.Configuring Host AccessIt might be desirable to limit the access of guest applications to the host.For example, if a Java method is exposed that calls System.exit then the guestapplication will be able to exit the host process.In order to avoid accidentally exposed methods, no host access is allowed bydefault and every public method or field needs to be annotated with@HostAccess.Export explicitly.                                  // COMPILE-CMD: javac {file}// RUN-CMD: java -ea {file}import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;import org.graalvm.polyglot.HostAccess;import org.graalvm.polyglot.PolyglotException;public class explicit_access_java_from_js {static// BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class Employee {    private final String name;    Employee(String name) {this.name = name;}    @HostAccess.Export    public String getName() {        return name;    }}//END-SNIPPETstatic//BEGIN-SNIPPETpublic class Services {    @HostAccess.Export    public Employee createEmployee(String name) {        return new Employee(name);    }        public void exitVM() {        System.exit(1);    }}public static void main(String[] args) {    try (Context context = Context.create()) {        Services services = new Services();        context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;services&quot;, services);        String name = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                &quot;let emp = services.createEmployee(&#39;John Doe&#39;);&quot; +                 &quot;emp.getName()&quot;).asString();        assert name.equals(&quot;John Doe&quot;);                try {            context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;services.exitVM()&quot;);            assert false;        } catch (PolyglotException e) {            assert e.getMessage().endsWith(                    &quot;Unknown identifier: exitVM&quot;);        }    }}// END-SNIPPET}                      JavaScript             In this code:  The class Employee is declared with a field name of type String. Access to the getName method is explicitly allowed by annotating the method with @HostAccess.Export.  The Services class exposes two methods createEmployee and exitVM. The createEmployee method takes the name of the employee as an argument and creates a new Employee instance. The createEmployee method is annotated with @HostAccess.Export and therefore accessible to the guest application. The exitVM method is not explicitly exported and therefore not accessible.  The main method first creates new polyglot context in the default configuration, disallowing host access except for methods annotated with @HostAccess.Export.  A new Services instance is created and put into the context as global variable services.  The first evaluated script creates a new employee using the services object and returns its name.  The returned name is asserted to equal the expected name John Doe.  A second script is evaluated that calls the exitVM method on the services object. This fails with a PolyglotException as the exitVM method is not exposed to the guest application.Host access is fully customizable by creating a custom HostAccess policy.Access Privilege ConfigurationIt is possible to configure fine-grained access privileges for guest applications.The configuration can be provided using the Context.Builder class when constructing a new context.The following access parameters may be configured:  Allow access to other languages using allowPolyglotAccess.  Allow and customize access to host objects using allowHostAccess.  Allow and customize host lookup to host types using allowHostLookup.  Allow host class loading using allowHostClassLoading.  Allow the creation of threads using allowCreateThread.  Allow access to native APIs using allowNativeAccess.  Allow access to IO using allowIO and proxy file accesses using fileSystem.Important: Granting access to class loading, native APIs or host IO effectively grants all access, as these privileges can be used to bypass other access restrictions.Build Native Images from Polyglot ApplicationsPolyglot embeddings can also be compiled using GraalVM Native Image.By default, no language is included if the polyglot API is used.To enable guest languages the --language:&amp;lt;languageId&amp;gt; (e.g., --language:js) native image option needs to be specified.All examples on this page are also supported when compiled using Native Image Generator – the native-image utility.Currently it is required to set the --initialize-at-build-time option when building with a polyglot language. We plan to lift this restriction in future versions.The following example shows how a simple HelloWorld JavaScript application can be built using native-image:$ javac HelloPolyglot.java$ native-image --language:js --initialize-at-build-time -cp . HelloPolyglot$ ./HelloPolyglotConfiguring Native Host ReflectionAccessing host Java code from the guest application requires Java reflection in order to work.When reflection is used within a native image, the reflection configuration file is required.For this example we use JavaScript to show host access with native images.Copy the following code in a new file named AccessJavaFromJS.java.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.proxy.*;import java.util.concurrent.*;public class AccessJavaFromJS {    public static class MyClass {        public int               id    = 42;        public String            text  = &quot;42&quot;;        public int[]             arr   = new int[]{1, 42, 3};        public Callable&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; ret42 = () -&amp;gt; 42;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                                   .allowAllAccess(true)                               .build()) {            context.getBindings(&quot;js&quot;).putMember(&quot;javaObj&quot;, new MyClass());            boolean valid = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;,                   &quot;    javaObj.id         == 42&quot;          +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.text       == &#39;42&#39;&quot;        +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.arr[1]     == 42&quot;          +                   &quot; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; javaObj.ret42()    == 42&quot;)               .asBoolean();            System.out.println(&quot;Valid &quot; + valid);        }    }}Next, copy the following code into reflect.json:[  { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;AccessJavaFromJS$MyClass&quot;, &quot;allPublicFields&quot;: true },  { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;java.util.concurrent.Callable&quot;, &quot;allPublicMethods&quot;: true }]Now the a native image can be created that supports host access:$ javac AccessJavaFromJS.java$ native-image --language:js --initialize-at-build-time -H:ReflectionConfigurationFiles=reflect.json -cp . AccessJavaFromJS$ ./accessjavafromjsNote that in case assertions are needed in the image the -H:+RuntimeAssertions option can be passed to native-image.For production deployments, this option should be omitted.Code Caching Across Multiple ContextsThe GraalVM Polyglot API allows enabling code caching across multiple contexts.Code caching allows compiled code to be reused and allows sources to be parsed only once.Often, code caching can reduce memory consumption and warmup time of the application.By default, code is cached within a single context instance only.In order to enable code caching between multiple contexts an explicit engine needs to be specified.The engine is specified when creating the context using the context builder.The scope of code sharing is determined by the engine instance.Code is only shared between contexts associated with one engine instance.All sources are cached by default.Caching may be disabled explicitly by setting cached(boolean cached) to false. Disabling caching may be useful in case the source is known to only be evaluated once.Consider the following code snippet as an example.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class Main {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Engine engine = Engine.create()) {            Source source = Source.create(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                                              .engine(engine)                                          .build()) {                int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                assert v == 42;            }            try (Context context = Context.newBuilder()                                              .engine(engine)                                          .build()) {                int v = context.eval(source).asInt();                assert v == 42;            }        }    }}In this code:   import org.graalvm.polyglot.* imports the base API for the Polyglot API.  Engine.create() creates a new engine instance with the default configuration.  Source.create() creates a source object for the expression “21 + 21”with “js” language, which is the language identifier for JavaScript.  Context.newBuilder().engine(engine).build() builds a new context withan explicit engine assigned to it. All contexts associated with an engine share the code.  context.eval(source).asInt() evaluates the source and returns the result as Value instance.Build a Shell for Many LanguagesWith just a few lines of code, the GraalVM Polyglot API lets you buildapplications that integrate with any guest language that is available bydefault with GraalVM.This shell implementation is agnostic to any particular guest language.BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));PrintStream output = System.out;Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; languages = context.getEngine().getLanguages().keySet();output.println(&quot;Shell for &quot; + languages + &quot;:&quot;);String language = languages.iterator().next();for (;;) {    try {        output.print(language + &quot;&amp;gt; &quot;);        String line = input.readLine();        if (line == null) {            break;        } else if (languages.contains(line)) {            language = line;            continue;        }        Source source = Source.newBuilder(language, line, &quot;&amp;lt;shell&amp;gt;&quot;)                        .interactive(true).buildLiteral();        context.eval(source);    } catch (PolyglotException t) {        if(t.isExit()) {            break;        }        t.printStackTrace();    }}Step through with Execution ListenersGraalVM Polyglot API allows to instrument the execution of guest languages through ExecutionListener class. For example, it lets you attach an execution listener that is invoked for every statement of the guest language program. Execution listenersare designed as simple API for polyglot embedders and may become handy in, e.g., single-stepping through the program.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.management.*;public class ExecutionListenerTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        try (Context context = Context.create(&quot;js&quot;)) {            ExecutionListener listener = ExecutionListener.newBuilder()                      .onEnter((e) -&amp;gt; System.out.println(                              e.getLocation().getCharacters()))                      .statements(true)                      .attach(context.getEngine());            context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;for (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; 2; i++);&quot;);            listener.close();        }    }}In this code:  The Context.create() call creates a new context for the guest language.  Create an execution listener builder by invoking ExecutionListeners.newBuilder().  Set onEnter event to notify when element’s execution is entered and consumed. At least one event consumer and one filtered source element needs to be enabled.  To complete the listener attachment, attach() needs to be invoked.  The statements(true) filters execution listeners to statements only.  The context.eval() call evaluates a specified snippet of guest language code.  The listener.close() closes a listener earlier, however execution listeners are automatically closed with the engine.",

Built on the GraalVM by Oracle Labs using the Truffle LanguageImplementation Framework and the GraalVM Compiler. TruffleRuby is one part ofGraalVM, a platform for high-performance polyglot programming.What is Truffle?The Truffle Language Implementation Framework is a Java framework for writingAST interpreters. To implement a language using Truffle you write an AST foryour language and add methods to interpret – perform the action of – eachnode.Truffle also has the concept of specialisation. In most AST interpreters thenodes are megamorphic – they handle all possible types and other possibleconditions. In the Truffle Framework you write several different nodes for thesame semantic action but for different types and conditions. As runtimeconditions change, you switch which nodes you are using. After the program haswarmed up you should end up with an AST that is precisely tailored for thetypes and conditions that you are actually using. If these conditions change,you can just switch nodes again.What is the GraalVM Compiler?The GraalVM Compiler is a new implementation of a just-in-time compiler (JITcompiler, or we’d normally say dynamic compiler) in the OpenJDK Java VirtualMachine. Unlike the current compilers, Graal is written in Java, and exposes aJava API to the running program. This means that instead of emitting bytecodea JVM language can directly control the compiler. However this is complicated,so normally the Truffle Framework uses the GraalVM compiler on your behalf topartially evaluate your AST interpreter into machine code.What is GraalVM?GraalVM is the platform on which TruffleRuby runs. It’s a system forhigh-performance polyglot programming.More concretely, GraalVM is a modified version of the OracleJDK that includesthe Truffle Framework, the GraalVM Compiler, TruffleRuby and other languagessupported by GraalVM including JavaScript, Python and R.See how to install GraalVM and TruffleRuby.How do I get TruffleRuby?The easiest way to get TruffleRuby is GraalVM.Why is TruffleRuby slow on a standard JVM?The expected way to run TruffleRuby is using the GraalVM Compiler. TruffleRubyisn’t designed to be efficient on a JVM without this.Why is TruffleRuby faster on the GraalVM?When running with the GraalVM Compiler, the Truffle Framework can use the APIexposed by the GraalVM Compiler. The Truffle Framework gets the bytecoderepresentation of all of the AST interpreter methods involved in running yourRuby method, combines them into something like a single Java method, optimisesthem together, and emits a single machine code function. The Truffle Frameworkalso provides wrappers for JVM functionality not normally available to Javaapplications such as code deoptimization. TruffleRuby uses this to provide adramatically simpler and faster implementation of Ruby.Where did this code come from?Chris Seaton wrote an implementation of Rubyon Truffle and Graal as part of an internship at Oracle Labs in the first halfof 2013. The code was merged into JRuby in early 2014. Benoit Daloze and KevinMenard joined as researchers in the second half of 2014, then Petr Chalupa in2015, Brandon Fish in 2016 and Duncan MacGregor in 2017. Since then we have alsoaccepted contributions from people outside Oracle Labs. In 2017 the code wasforked back out of JRuby after it had matured.Who do I ask about TruffleRuby?See the Contact section in the README.How do I know if I’m using TruffleRuby?RUBY_ENGINE will be &#39;truffleruby&#39;.How do I know if I’m using a VM that has the GraalVM Compiler?ruby --version will report GraalVM CE or EE.TruffleRuby.jit? will tell you if you are also running with the GraalVMCompiler.How do I know that I’m using the Community Edition of GraalVM?ruby --version will report GraalVM CE.How do I know that I’m using the Enterprise Edition of GraalVM?ruby --version will report GraalVM EE.How do I know that I’m using the native version of TruffleRuby?ruby --version will report Native.TruffleRuby.native? will return true.How can I see the GraalVM Compiler is working?Put this program into test.rb:loop do  14 + 2endWe’ll use the --engine.TraceCompilation to ask the TruffleFramework to tell us when it compiles something using the GraalVM Compiler.$ ruby --engine.TraceCompilation test.rb[truffle] opt done         block in &amp;lt;main&amp;gt; test.rb:1 &amp;lt;opt&amp;gt; &amp;lt;split-3a9ffa1b&amp;gt;         |ASTSize       8/    8 |Time   103(  99+4   )ms |DirectCallNodes I    0/D    0 |GraalNodes    24/    3 |CodeSize           69 |CodeAddress 0x11245cf50 |Source   ../test.rb:1Here you can see that Truffle has decided to use the GraalVM Compiler tocompile the block of 127 - the loop to machine code - just 69 bytes of machinecode in all.Why doesn’t TruffleRuby perform well for my benchmark?Benchmarks that we haven’t looked at yet may require new code paths to bespecialized. Currently we’ve added specialisation for the code paths in thebenchmarks and applications that we’ve been using. Adding them is generally notcomplicated and over time we will have specialisations to cover a broad range ofapplications.Make sure that you are using the Enterprise Edition of GraalVM, and haverebuilt the executable images for the bestperformance.How is this related to invokedynamic?TruffleRuby doesn’t use invokedynamic, as it doesn’t emit bytecode. However itdoes have an optimising method dispatch mechanism that achieves a similarresult.Why doesn’t JRuby switch to Truffle as well?JRuby is taking a different approach to optimising and adding new functionalityto Ruby. Both JRuby and TruffleRuby are important projects.Why did you fork from JRuby?We merged into JRuby in order to be able to use large parts of their Javaimplementation code. We forked back out of JRuby when we had got to the pointwhere the code that we were using needed to be modified for our purposes and weno longer had any dependency on the core part of JRuby. Forking also allowed usto simplify our code base.",

The Windows distribution includesthe JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, the functional gu utility toinstall additional components, GraalVM’s JavaScript engine and the developer tools(e.g., Chrome inspector based debugger, Profiler, etc.). GraalVM Native Imagecomponent needs to be installed with gu as with other distributions. Node.js support on the Windowsplatform is scheduled to be included in the next GraalVM release (20.1).Can I run my existing application with GraalVM?The team behind GraalVM aims for compatibility with existing languageimplementations. Java and JavaScript programs are expected to run fullycompatible out-of-the-box. This includes the code written in other JVMlanguages, such as Scala or Kotlin, and GraalVM treats Node.js as if it is a JVMlanguage. LLVM-based languages are fully supported via the LLVM bitcodeexecution environment. For Ruby, R, and Python we are working on improvedcompatibility. Specific applications may run. Several third parties have startedtheir own development of GraalVM-based language implementations. We continue togrow the ecosystem of GraalVM languages such that GraalVM can truly run ‘anylanguage’.What makes GraalVM a true ‘polyglot’ VM?GraalVM can not only run individual languages with competitive performance, italso enables high-performance language interoperability. Languages can accesseach other’s data structures and call each other’s methods. We avoid costlyconversions of data structures and instead allow data structures to be sharedbetween languages. Our tooling is built in language-agnostic ways to unify taskslike debugging or profiling. This simplifies deployment and configurationof the runtime environment. Important VM components like thejust-in-time-compiler and garbage collector are all fully shared across alllanguages.What does it mean to run any language ‘anywhere’?GraalVM can run embedded in OpenJDK, Oracle JDK or Node.js platforms,standalone, or embedded in data stores like the Oracle Database. In all scenarios, the sameunderlying compilation and language execution technology runs in-process andwith direct access to data structures of the surrounding system. Separation oflogical and physical data layout is a first class principle for GraalVM andenables flexible use of data structures without marshalling costs. We encouragethe embedding of GraalVM in other projects and publish APIs for that purpose. Weenvision a future where high-performance and standardized language executiontechnology is available without the need for provisioning separate VMdeployments.Can I use GraalVM with microservices frameworks?GraalVM can run any Java microservices framework. Several Java microservicesframeworks have already accepted the GraalVM Native Imagetechnology as a platform. Examples include: Helidon,Quarkus, Micronaut. For theseframeworks GraalVM Native Image significantly reduces the startup time andruntime memory requirements.Can GraalVM run Spring applications?GraalVM can run Spring applications, compiled with OpenJDK, OracleJDK or other JVMs.Here is a Spring application example thatnot only runs on GraalVM, but also applies the R language to visualize a plot of the data, usingGraalVM polyglot capabilities.Spring Framework support of GraalVM Native Imagetechnology is in its initial stages.The ability of GraalVM to create executable native images of Spring applications is only partially supported.GraalVM Native Image has limitations on what Java functionality it can compile ahead-of-time.The GraalVM team is investigating what can be done to fully support compiling Spring applications to native images.What is the status of IDE integration?GraalVM supports major IDEs, as well as major debugging protocols. Eclipse,NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code are possible IDEs since they supportall languages within one environment. IntelliJ Enterprise edition has strongsupport for all languages even within one file. GraalVM provides a built-inimplementation of Chrome DevTools Protocol that, in addition to debuggingJavaScript, even enables debugging of R and Ruby applications, separately oracross languages. You can get a multilingual stacktrace that way.What are existing real-world production deployments of GraalVM?Several production deployments of GraalVM exist today. For example, Christian Thalinger from Twitter describes the production deployment ofGraalVM at Twitter and how it can help save money via improved performance inhis interview Accelerating Processing at Twitter  and how they save money using GraalVM.We thank early adopters of our technology who give us feedback on the project and help us develop new features.",

                    "content": "Get started with GraalVM – a standalone Java Development Kit to execute Java or JVM-basedlanguages (e.g., Scala, Kotlin), dynamic languages (e.g., JavaScript, R, Ruby, R,Python), WebAssembly, LLVM-based languages (e.g., C and C++) in one shared runtime. Thispage guides you through downloading and installing GraalVM Community and adding supportfor additional languages or components and shows you how to run simple programs.GraalVM 20.1.0 is available as GraalVM Community and GraalVM Enterprise editions.GraalVM Community editions are based on OpenJDK version 1.8.0_252 and on OpenJDK version 11.0.7.GraalVM Enterprise editions are based on Oracle JDK version 1.8.0_251 and on Oracle JDK version 11.0.7.GraalVM distributions are available for Linux, macOS and Windows platforms on x86 64-bit systems. Proceed to the GraalVM distributions list to see a complete summary.Besides the core components of GraalVM (the JVM, the GraalVM compiler, the LLVMruntime, and the JavaScript runtime with Node.js support), the base installation canbe extended with:  Native Image  LLVM toolchain  Python interpreter  Ruby interpreter  R interpreter  WebAssembly interpreterInstall GraalVMGetting GraalVM installed and ready-to-go should only take a few minutes.Choose a platform and proceed to the installation steps:  Linux  macOS  WindowsRunning ApplicationsIn this getting started guide we will focus on working with GraalVM CommunityEdition based on OpenJDK 8.The executables of all language runtimes in GraalVM emulate the behavior of thelanguages’ default runtimes. Setting GraalVM to the PATH and JAVA_HOMEenvironment variables during the installation should be enough to run anapplication with GraalVM.GraalVM’s /bin directory is similar to that of a standard JDK, but includes a set of additional launchers:  js runs a JavaScript console with GraalVM.  node is a drop-in replacement for Node.js, using GraalVM’s JavaScript engine.  lli is a high-performance LLVM bitcode interpreter integrated with GraalVM.  gu (GraalVM Updater) can be used to install language packs for Python, R, and Ruby.Check the versions of the default runtimes:$ java -versionopenjdk version &quot;1.8.0_252&quot;OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_252-b09)OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 20.1.0 (build 25.252-b09-jvmci-20.1-b02, mixed mode)$ node -vv12.15.0$ lli --versionLLVM (GraalVM CE Native 20.1.0)The Ruby, Python, R, Wasm launchers become available only if you install thecorresponding languages engines. For installing languages, see below.Running JavaThe  java launchers runs the JVM with GraalVM’s default compiler.Take a look at this typical HelloWorld class:public class HelloWorld {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);  }}Run the following command to compile this class to bytecode and then run it on GraalVM:$ javac HelloWorld.java$ java HelloWorldHello World!You can find a collection of larger examples of Java applications you can try running with GraalVM on the examples page.Running JavaScriptGraalVM can execute plain JavaScript code, both in REPL mode and by executing script files directly.$ js&amp;gt; 1 + 23GraalVM also supports running Node.js applications. More than 100,000 npmpackages are regularly tested and are compatible with GraalVM, including moduleslike express, react, async, request, browserify, grunt, mocha, and underscore.To install a Node.js module, use the npm executable in the /bin folder ofthe GraalVM package. The npm command is equivalent to the default Node.jscommand and supports all Node.js APIs.1. Install the colors and ansispan modules using npm install:npm install colors ansispanAfter the modules are installed, you can use them from your application.2. Add the following code snippet to a file named app.js and save it in the same directory where you installed the Node.js modules:                          // RUN-CMD: rm -rf node_modules// RUN-CMD: npm install ansispan colors// RUN-CMD: node {file}// RUN-CMD: rm -r node_modules// BEGIN-SNIPPETconst http = require(&quot;http&quot;);const span = require(&quot;ansispan&quot;);require(&quot;colors&quot;);http.createServer(function (request, response) {    response.writeHead(200, {&quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;text/html&quot;});    response.end(span(&quot;Hello Graal.js!&quot;.green));}).listen(8000, function() { console.log(&quot;Graal.js server running at http://127.0.0.1:8000/&quot;.red); });// END-SNIPPETsetTimeout(function() { console.log(&quot;DONE!&quot;); process.exit(); }, 2000);      3. Execute it on GraalVM using the node command:node app.jsMore information on compatibility with the Node.js and configuring GraalVM read the reference manual on JavaScript in GraalVM.Running LLVM BitcodeThe GraalVM LLVM runtime can execute C/C++, Rust, and other programminglanguage that can be compiled to LLVM bitcode. A native program has to becompiled to LLVM bitcode using an LLVM frontend such as clang. C/C++ code canbe compiled to LLVM bitcode using clang shipped with GraalVM via a pre-builtLLVM toolchain.To set up the LLVM toolchain support, execute the following commands:$ gu install llvm-toolchain$ export LLVM_TOOLCHAIN=$(lli --print-toolchain-path)Please note, the installation of the LLVM toolchain component is possible only from GitHub catalog for both GraalVM Community and Enterprise users.Put this C code example into a file named hello.c:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;int main() {    printf(&quot;Hello from GraalVM!n&quot;);    return 0;}Then compile hello.c to an executable hello with embedded LLVM bitcode and run it as follows:$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang hello.c -o hello$ lli helloMore examples and information on running LLVM bitcode with GraalVM can be found in the reference manual for LLVM.Running RubyThe Ruby engine is not installed by default, but it can be added using GraalVM Updater:gu install rubyThe above command will install a community version of a component from GitHub catalog.For GraalVM Enterprise users, the manual component installation is required.Then the Ruby launchers like ruby, gem, irb, rake, rdoc and ri will become available:$ ruby [options] program.rbGraalVM Ruby implementation uses thesame options as the standard implementation of Ruby,with some additions.$ gem install chunky_png$ ruby -r chunky_png -e &quot;puts ChunkyPNG::Color.to_hex(ChunkyPNG::Color(&#39;mintcream @ 0.5&#39;))&quot;#f5fffa80Using BundlerGraalVM implementation of Ruby ships with the Bundler environment.Therefore its installation, gem install bundler, is not needed.$ bundle exec ...More examples and additional information on Ruby support in GraalVM can be found in the reference manual for Ruby.Running PythonGraalVM provides an early-stage implementation of Python 3.7.The Python engine is not available by default, but it can be added using GraalVM Updater:gu install pythonThe above command will install a community version of a component from GitHub catalog. For GraalVM Enterprise users, the manual component installation is required.Once the Python engine is installed, GraalVM can execute Python programs:$ graalpython...&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1 + 23&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; exit()More examples and additional information on Python support in GraalVM can be found in the reference manual for Python.Running RThe R engine is not installed by default, and can be added using GraalVM Updater:gu install RPlease note, the installation of the R language component is possible only from GitHub catalog for both GraalVM Community and Enterprise users.When the R engine is installed, you can execute R scripts and use the R REPL with GraalVM:$ RR version 3.6.1 (FastR)...&amp;gt; 1 + 1[1] 2More examples and additional information on R support in GraalVM can be found in the reference manual for R.Combine LanguagesIf enabled, using the --polyglot flag, scripts executed on GraalVM can use interoperability features to call into other languages and exchange data with them.For example, running js --jvm --polyglot example.js executes example.js in a polyglot context.If the program calls any code in other supported languages, GraalVM executes that code inthe same runtime as the example.js application. For more information on polyglot applications see the polyglot documentation.Native ImagesGraalVM can compile Java bytecode into native images to achieve faster startupand smaller footprint for your applications. The Native Image functionality isnot available by default but can be easily installed. Run the following commandto install Native Image in GraalVM Community:gu install native-imageFor GraalVM Enterprise users, the manual component installation is required.The HelloWorld example from above is used here to demonstrate how to compileJava bytecode into a native image:// HelloWorld.javapublic class HelloWorld {  public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);  }}Run the following to compile the class to bytecode and then build a native image:$ javac HelloWorld.java$ native-image HelloWorldThis builds an executable file named helloworld in the current working directory.Invoking it executes the natively compiled code of the HelloWorld class as follows:$ ./helloworldHello, World!Polyglot Capabilities of Native ImagesGraalVM Native Image Generator also makes it easy to use polyglot capabilities.Take this example of a JSON pretty-printer using the GraalVM implementation of JavaScript:// PrettyPrintJSON.javaimport java.io.*;import java.util.stream.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;public class PrettyPrintJSON {  public static void main(String[] args) throws java.io.IOException {    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));    String input = reader.lines().collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));    try (Context context = Context.create(&quot;js&quot;)) {      Value parse = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;JSON.parse&quot;);      Value stringify = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;JSON.stringify&quot;);      Value result = stringify.execute(parse.execute(input), null, 2);      System.out.println(result.asString());    }  }}The --language:js argument ensures that the JavaScript engine is available in the generated image:$ javac PrettyPrintJSON.java$ native-image --language:js --initialize-at-build-time PrettyPrintJSONThe native image generation will take several minutes as it does not just buildthe PrettyPrintJSON class, but includes building a JavaScript engine(along with the support for partial evaluation). Additionally, the image buildingrequires large amounts of physical memory, especially if you build an image withTruffle Language Implementation Framework included, which is exactly the casehere. Memory  requirements and some other limitations of ahead-of-timecompilation with GraalVM are listedhere.The resulting executable can now perform JSON pretty printing:$ ./prettyprintjson &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF{&quot;GraalVM&quot;:{&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Language Abstraction Platform&quot;,&quot;supports&quot;:[&quot;combining languages&quot;,&quot;embedding languages&quot;,&quot;creating native images&quot;],&quot;languages&quot;: [&quot;Java&quot;,&quot;JavaScript&quot;,&quot;Node.js&quot;, &quot;Python&quot;, &quot;Ruby&quot;,&quot;R&quot;,&quot;LLVM&quot;]}}EOFHere is the JSON output from the native executable:{  &quot;GraalVM&quot;: {    &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Language Abstraction Platform&quot;,    &quot;supports&quot;: [      &quot;combining languages&quot;,      &quot;embedding languages&quot;,      &quot;creating native images&quot;    ],    &quot;languages&quot;: [      &quot;Java&quot;,      &quot;JavaScript&quot;,      &quot;Node.js&quot;,      &quot;Python&quot;,      &quot;Ruby&quot;,      &quot;R&quot;,      &quot;LLVM&quot;    ]  }}The native image is much faster than running the same code on the JVM directly:$ time bin/java PrettyPrintJSON &amp;lt; test.json &amp;gt; /dev/nullreal0m1.101suser0m2.471ssys0m0.237s$ time ./prettyprintjson &amp;lt; test.json &amp;gt; /dev/nullreal0m0.037suser0m0.015ssys0m0.016sGraalVM Container ImagesGraalVM Community container images are available for download from GitHub Packages.As long as GitHub does not support anonymous access you need to login to the registry to authenticate against the GitHub Package server.You can authenticate to GitHub Packages with Docker using the docker logincommand. It is required to use a personal access token with the appropriatescopes for authentication. Learn how to generate personal access tokens here.As a best practice, it is suggested to save yourpersonal access token in a file locally. Then run the dockerlogin command non-interactively so you can set the --password-stdin flag toprovide a token. The following example shows how to read a token from a file andpass it to the docker login command using STDIN:cat ~/TOKEN.txt | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u USERNAME --password-stdinSubstitute USERNAME with your GitHub username and ~/TOKEN.txt with the filepath to the file containing your personal access token. Once you haveauthenticated, there are two ways to install GraalVM Community container imagespublished as GitHub Packages.  Pull the image from GitHub with docker pull:    docker pull docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:latest    Alternatively, use as the base image in Dockerfile:    FROM docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:latest  There are different GraalVM Community container images provided depending on thearchitecture and Java version. A complete list can be found on the All versions page. The images are named per a platform-os-jdk-version naming scheme, for example,docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:ol8-java11-20.1.0. Theimages for 64-bit ARM architecture are prefixed with the arm64- tag, e.g.,docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:arm64-ol8-java11-20.1.0.The container image is based on Oracle Linux and has GraalVM Communitydownloaded, unzipped and made available. It means that Java, JavaScript, Nodeand the LLVM interpreter are available out of the box.You can start a container and enter the bash session with the following run command:docker run -it docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0 bashCheck that java, js and other commands work as expected.→ docker run -it docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0 bashbash-4.4# java -versionopenjdk version &quot;11.0.7&quot; 2020-04-14OpenJDK Runtime Environment GraalVM CE 20.1.0 (build 11.0.7+10-jvmci-20.1-b02)OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM GraalVM CE 20.1.0 (build 11.0.7+10-jvmci-20.1-b02, mixed mode, sharing)bash-4.4# nodeWelcome to Node.js v12.15.0.Type &quot;.help&quot; for more information.&amp;gt; 1 + 12&amp;gt; process.exit()bash-4.4# lli --versionLLVM (GraalVM CE Native 20.1.0)bash-4.4#Please note that the image contains only the components immediately available in the GraalVM Community distribution.However, the GraalVM Updater utility is on the PATH.You can install the support for additional languages like Ruby, R, Python or WebAssembly at will.For example, the following command installs the Ruby support (the output below is truncated for brevity):docker run -it docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0 bashbash-4.4# gu install rubyDownloading: Component catalogProcessing component archive: Component rubyDownloading: Component ruby[######              ]...If you want to mount a directory from the host system to have it locally available in the container,use Docker volumes.Here is a sample command that maps the /absolute/path/to/directory/no/trailing/slash directory from the host system to the /path/inside/container inside the container.docker run -it -v /absolute/path/to/directory/no/trailing/slash:/path/inside/container docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0 bashIf you want to create docker images that contain GraalVM Ruby, R, or Python implementation, you can use a Dockerfile like the example below, which uses docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0 as the base image, installs Ruby support using the gu utility, then creates and runs a sample Ruby program.FROM docker.pkg.github.com/graalvm/container/community:20.1.0RUN gu install rubyWORKDIR /workdirRUN echo &#39;puts &quot;Hello from Truffleruby!nVersion: #{RUBY_DESCRIPTION}&quot;&#39; &amp;gt; app.rbCMD ruby app.rbIf you put the above snippet in a Dockerfile in the current directory,you can build and run it with the following commands:docker build -t truffleruby-demo ....$ docker run -it --rm truffleruby-demoHello from Truffleruby!Version: truffleruby 20.1.0, like ruby 2.6.5, GraalVM CE Native [x86_64-darwin]What to read next?If you want to learn what GraalVM offers to different types of teams, read the Why GraalVM page.

These include:  GraalVM Native Image – a technology to compile an application ahead-of-time into a binary that runs natively on the system. Note: The Native Image plugin is available as an Early Adopter technology in GraalVM Enterprise. In GraalVM Community Native Image is distributed under the GPL 2 with Classpath Exception license.  LLVM toolchain –  a set of tools and APIs for compiling native programs to bitcode that can be executed with the GraalVM LLVM runtime.  Python interpreter –  a Python 3.7 compliant implementation.  Ruby interpreter – an implementation of the Ruby 2.6.5 programming language.  R interpreter – a GNU R 3.6.1 compatible implementation of the R programming language.  GraalWasm –  the WebAssembly (Wasm) language interpreter to run Wasm programs in the binary format.Note: Python, R, Ruby and Wasm are experimental and not recommended for production use at this time.To assist you with the installation, these features are pre-packaged ascomponents. The GraalVM installation contains the GraalVM Updaterutility, gu, that can be used to manage components. GraalVM Updater alsoverifies whether the version of the component is appropriate for your GraalVMinstallation. Component packages are released for each GraalVM release withrespective updates. Component packages downloaded for previous release(s) cannotbe used with newer ones.To deploy the installer tool, confirm that GraalVM is set in your PATH environment variable.There is a command-line help available.Run gu or gu -h to get commands overview.Run gu &amp;lt;command&amp;gt; -h to get help specific for the particular command, for example gu install -h.A component may depend on requiring other components for its operation. GraalVM Updaterverifies such requirements and will attempt to download the required dependencies, orabort the installation if component’s requirements are not met.Note: Components intended for GraalVM Enterprise Edition can not be installed into GraalVM Community Edition.Component Installation ModesThree modes of components installation are supported:Manual InstallationDepending on the GraalVM distribution, you download a component package from GitHub or Oracle Technology Network and GraalVM Updater will install it. The following pre-built packages are at your disposal:  native-image.jar  python-installable.jar  ruby-installable.jar  r-installable.jar  llvm_toolchain.jar  wasm.jarWith the already downloaded component JAR file, the component can be installed asgu -L install component.jarwhere -L option, equivalent to --local-file or --file, tells to installfrom the downloaded component archive. However, a component may depend on othercomponents (e.g., Ruby language depends on the LLVM toolchain). For example, gu-L install component.jar will fail if the required components are not yetinstalled. If you download all the dependencies into the same directory, you mayuse:gu -L install -DCheck gu --help or gu -C (see below) how to instruct GraalVM Updater to find and process required components as well.Installation from CatalogThere is a component catalog on GitHub maintained by Oracle, fromwhich you can install a component just by its name. GraalVM Updater firstdownloads the list of components, then uses the information in the list todownload the actual component package and installs it.To get a list of components available in the catalog, their IDs, and descriptive names, usegu availableThen the ComponentId, for example ruby, can be used as:gu install rubyIf you want to see more verbose messages during installation, you may use the-v or --verbose switch to see the download progress bar and verbose messages.If a component being installed requires other components to be present, GraalVMUpdater will search the Catalog to find the appropriate component and install itas well. If required components could not be found, installation will fail.When using custom catalog URLs, it is possible, as a convenience, to setenvironment variable GRAALVM_CATALOG pointing to the custom catalog’s URL.GraalVM updater will use URL defined by GRAALVM_CATALOG in preference tothe builtin ones. You may setup the environment variable in startup or profilescripts.Note, for GraalVM Enterprise Edition users, components should be obtained from Oracle Technology Network which requires a manual installation toprevent the use of a “community” component version except for the R language andLLVM toolchain components which are available only from GitHub catalog.Installation from Local Components CollectionComponents can be downloaded manually in advance to a local file folder, or to afolder shared on the local network. GraalVM Updater can then use that folderinstead of the catalog:gu install -C /path/to/downloads/directory &amp;lt;component name&amp;gt;specifying the directory to use as components collection. It is possible to typecomponents names (like ruby) instead of filenames. GraalVM Updater alsoattempts to find required dependencies in the local component collection.When installing components from the given directory, you can allow installing allcomponents which have correct version number for the GraalVM core using wildcards:./gu install -C ~/Download/Components/ *For example, gu install native* will install the native-image component, or anything that starts with native.Similar to the installation from catalog, the path to the directory thatcontains local components collection can be defined in the GRAALVM_CATALOGenvironment variable.Installed on your machine components can be printed with:gu listInstallation ConfigurationThe installation command of GraalVM Updater accepts multiple options and parameters and allows this syntax:gu install [-0cCfFiLnorsuvyxY] param [param ...]The following options are currently supported:  -0, --dry-run: dry run, do not change anything  -c, --catalog: treat parameters as component IDs from the GraalVM components catalog. This is the default  -C, --custom-catalog &amp;lt;url&amp;gt;: use a specific catalog URL to locate components  -L, --local-file: treat parameters as local filenames of packaged components  -f, --force: force overwrite, bypass version checks  -i, --fail-existing: fail on an existing component  -n, --no-progress: do not display the downloading progress  -o, --overwrite: overwrite different files  -r, --replace: replace existing components  -s, --no-verify-jars: skip integrity verification of component archives  -u, --url: interpret parameters as URLs of packaged components  -v, --verbose: be verbose. Prints versions and dependency information  -x, --ignore: ignore failures  -y, --only-validate: do not install, just check compatibility and conflicting files  -Y, --validate-before: download, verify, check file conflicts before any disk change is madeFinally, customers using Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition might need to pass anadditional verification step to login to Oracle components repository. GraalVMUpdater tool provides options for that:  --public-key / -k &amp;lt;path&amp;gt; to set the path to a custom GPG public key path  --username/-U to enter a usernameRebuilding ImagesGraalVM components used to create guest language implementations may change overtime, requiring a Native Image to be rebuilt. Polyglot native image and polyglotnative C library may be out of sync, particularly:  new languages may not be accessible;  removed languages may cause the native binary to fail on missing resources or libraries.To rebuild and refresh the native binaries, use the following command:gu rebuild-images [--verbose] polyglot|libpolyglot|js|llvm|python|ruby [custom native-image args]UninstallationComponents may be uninstalled from the GraalVM environment when no longer needed.To uninstall a specific component you need to know its ComponentId, which can be ruby, or r and so on.The command to uninstall the component is:gu remove ComponentIdIf more components end with, for example, ruby, the installer will print anerror message that you need to use component’s full names (org.graalvm.ruby).The uninstallation removes the files created during the installation. If a filebelongs to multiple components, it will be removed when the last component usingit is removed.ProxiesIf GraalVM Updater needs to reach the component catalog, or download acomponent package, it may need to pass through the HTTP proxy, if your networkuses one. On macOS, the proxy settings are automatically obtained from the OS.On Linux, you must ensure that the http_proxy and https_proxy environmentvariables are set appropriately before you launch gu. Please refer to yourdistribution and/or desktop environment documentation for the details.Sometimes, an intermediate (e.g., corporate) proxy may act as“man-in-the-middle”, intercepting https-secured communication and issuing itsown host certificates, which cannot be verified by GraalVM Updater. If you seeerror messages with descriptions containing ValidatorException orSunCertPathBuilderException, it is obviously the culprit.GraalVM Updater intentionally does not supportan option to disable certificate or hostname verification, for security reasons.You may try to add your proxy’s certificate to the GraalVM default security truststore (see JDK documentation for the details).Working without Internet AccessIf your machine cannot access and download Catalog and GraalVM components fromthe Internet, either because it is behind a proxy, or for security reasons,Graal Updater can install components from a local directory, or a directory ona network share accessible on the target machine.You need to prepare a directory, download all Components that you want to installand their dependencies (in case they require other GraalVM Components to work) intothat directory.Then you can use gu -L install /path/to/file (where -L option instructs to use local files,equivalent to –local-file or –file). Adding -D option will instruct Graal Updaterto look for potential dependencies in the directory next to theinstallable file. Additionally, gu -C /path/to/download/dir install component can be used, the specifieddirectory contents acting as a Catalog of components.Note that with gu -L you need to specify the component’s file name, whilewhen using gu -C &amp;lt;dir&amp;gt;, the component name must be used:# Specify file locationgu -LD install /tmp/installables/fastr.jar# Specify component namegu -C /tmp/instalables install rReplacing Components and FilesA component may be only installed once. GraalVM Updater refuses to install acomponent if a component with the same ComponentId is already installed. But theinstalled component may be replaced. GraalVM Updater first uninstalls thecomponent and then installs a new package. To replace a component, use the-r option. The -L option, equivalent to --file or --local-file, tells to treat parameters as local filename of a packaged component.gu install -L -r component.jargu install -r rubyThe process is the same as if gu remove is run first and gu install next.GraalVM Updater also refuses to overwrite existing files if the to-be-installedand existing versions differ. There are cases when you may need to refresh filecontents, if they were modified or damaged. Use the -o option:gu install -L -o component.jargu install -o rubyGraalVM Updater will just instruct to replace the contained files of acomponent. By default, it will not alter anything. You can also use -f(--force) option, which disables most of the checks and allows you to installnon-matching versions.TroubleshootingIf a language component is not installed running the code that tries to initialize the language context can result in an exception like this:java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerErrorCaused by: com.oracle.truffle.polyglot.PolyglotIllegalArgumentException: A language with id &#39;$language&#39; is not installed. Installed languages are: [js, llvm].If you see a problem like that, install the language component as explained on this page above.",

                    "content": "GraalVM InsightGraalVM Insight tool is for tracing a program runtime behavior and insightsgathering. It is a multipurpose, flexible tool for writing reliablemicroservices solutions.The dynamic nature of the tool helps to selectively apply tracing pointcuts onalready running applications with no loss of performance. GraalVM Insightprovides detailed access to runtime behavior of a program allowing a user toinspect values, types at invocation or allocation sites, gathering usefulinformation and collecting and presenting it. GraalVM Insight permits tomodify computed values, interrupt execution and quickly experiment withbehavioral changes without modifying the application code.This page provides information on GraalVM Insight as of 20.1 version.To learn about GraalVM Insight versions 20.0 and 19.3, proceed here.Note: The GraalVM Insight functionality is offered as a technology preview and requires topass the --experimental-options option to enable the --insightinstrument.Start Using GraalVM Insight  Create a simple source-tracing.js script with following content:    insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, function(ev) { print(`Loading ${ev.characters.length} characters from ${ev.name}`);});    Having set JAVA_HOME to GraalVM home directory, start the node launcher withthe --insight instrument and observe what scripts are being loaded andevaluated:    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/node --experimental-options --insight=source-tracing.js --js.print -e &quot;print(&#39;The result: &#39; + 6 * 7)&quot; | tail -n 10Loading 29938 characters from url.jsLoading 345 characters from internal/idna.jsLoading 12642 characters from punycode.jsLoading 33678 characters from internal/modules/cjs/loader.jsLoading 13058 characters from vm.jsLoading 52408 characters from fs.jsLoading 15920 characters from internal/fs/utils.jsLoading 505 characters from [eval]-wrapperLoading 29 characters from [eval]The result: 42    The GraalVM Insight source-tracing.js script used the provided insight object toattach a source listener to the runtime. Whenever the script was loaded, thelistener got notified of it and could take an action – printing the length andname of processed script.  The insights information can be collected to a print statement or a histogram.The following function-histogram-tracing.js script counts all method invocationsand dumps the most frequent ones when the execution of a program is over:var map = new Map();function dumpHistogram() {    print(&quot;==== Histogram ====&quot;);    var digits = 3;    Array.from(map.entries()).sort((one, two) =&amp;gt; two[1] - one[1]).forEach(function (entry) {        var number = entry[1].toString();        if (number.length &amp;gt;= digits) {            digits = number.length;        } else {            number = Array(digits - number.length + 1).join(&#39; &#39;) + number;        }        if (number &amp;gt; 10) print(`${number} calls to ${entry[0]}`);    });    print(&quot;===================&quot;);}insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ev) {    var cnt = map.get(ev.name);    if (cnt) {        cnt = cnt + 1;    } else {        cnt = 1;    }    map.set(ev.name, cnt);}, {    roots: true});insight.on(&#39;close&#39;, dumpHistogram);The map is a global variable shared inside of the GraalVM Insight script that allows thecode to share data between the insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;) function and the dumpHistogramfunction.

Create source-trace.js file:    insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, function(ev) {if (ev.uri.indexOf(&#39;gems&#39;) === -1) {  let n = ev.uri.substring(ev.uri.lastIndexOf(&#39;/&#39;) + 1);  print(&#39;JavaScript instrument observed load of &#39; + n);}});    Prepare the helloworld.rb Ruby file:    puts &#39;Hello from GraalVM Ruby!&#39;    Apply the JavaScript instrument to the Ruby program:    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/ruby --jvm --polyglot --experimental-options --insight=source-trace.js helloworld.rbJavaScript instrument observed load of helloworld.rbHello from GraalVM Ruby!    It is necessary to start GraalVM’s Ruby launcher with --polyglot parameter as the source-tracing.js script remains written in JavaScript.  A user can instrument any GraalVM language, but also the GraalVM Insight scripts can bewritten in any GraalVM supported language.  Create the source-tracing.rb Ruby file:    puts &quot;Ruby: Initializing GraalVM Insight script&quot;insight.on(&#39;source&#39;, -&amp;gt;(ev) { name = ev[:name] puts &quot;Ruby: observed loading of #{name}&quot;})puts &#39;Ruby: Hooks are ready!&#39;    Launch a Node.js application and instrument it with the Ruby written script:    $ $JAVA_HOME/bin/node --jvm  --polyglot --experimental-options --insight=source-tracing.rb --js.print -e &quot;print(&#39;With Ruby: &#39; + 6 * 7)&quot; | grep RubyRuby: Initializing GraalVM Insight scriptRuby: Hooks are ready!Ruby: observed loading of internal/per_context/primordials.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/per_context/setup.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/per_context/domexception.js....Ruby: observed loading of internal/modules/cjs/loader.jsRuby: observed loading of vm.jsRuby: observed loading of fs.jsRuby: observed loading of internal/fs/utils.jsRuby: observed loading of [eval]-wrapperRuby: observed loading of [eval]With Ruby: 42  Inspecting ValuesGraalVM Insight not only allows one to trace where the program execution is happening,it also offers access to values of local variables and function arguments duringprogram execution. You can, for example, write instrument that shows the value ofargument n in the function fib:insight.on(&#39;enter&#39;, function(ctx, frame) {   print(&#39;fib for &#39; + frame.n);}, {   roots: true,   rootNameFilter: (name) =&amp;gt; &#39;fib&#39; === name});This instrument uses the second function argument, frame, to get access to values oflocal variables inside every instrumented function. The above scriptalso uses rootNameFilter to apply its hook only to function named fib:function fib(n) {  if (n &amp;lt; 1) return 0;  if (n &amp;lt; 2) return 1;  else return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);}print(&quot;Two is the result &quot; + fib(3));When the instrument is stored in a fib-trace.js file and the actual code is infib.js, invoking the following command yields detailed information about theprogram execution and parameters passed between function invocations:$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/node --experimental-options --insight=fib-trace.js --js.print fib.jsfib for 3fib for 2fib for 1fib for 0fib for 1Two is the result 2To learn more about GraalVM Insight, continue reading here reference.

                    "content": "Getting started with Instruments in GraalVMTools are sometimes referred to as Instruments within the GraalVM platform.The Truffle Instrument API is used to implement such instruments.Instruments can track very fine-grained VM-level runtime events to profile, inspect, and analyze the runtime behavior of applications running on GraalVM.Simple ToolTo provide an easier starting point for tool developers we have created aSimple Tool example project. This is ajavadoc-rich maven project which implements a simple code coverage tool. Werecommend cloning the repository and exploring the source code as a startingpoint for tool development. The following sections will give a guided tour ofthe steps needed to build and run a GraalVM tool, using Simple Tool source codeas the running example. These sections do not cover all the features of theTruffle Instrumentation API so we encourage you to check the javadoc for more details.The RequirementsAs mentioned before, Simple Tool is a code coverage tool. Ultimately, itshould provide the developer with information on what percentage of source codelines was executed, as well as exactly which lines were executed. With that inmind, we can define some high level requirements from our tool:  The tool keeps track of loaded source code  The tool keeps track of executed source code  On application exit, the tool calculates and prints per line coverage informationTruffle InstrumentThe main starting point for Truffle tools is subclassing the TruffleInstrument class.Unsurprisingly, the simple tool code base does exactly this creating the SimpleCoverageInstrument class.TheRegistrationannotation on the class ensures that the newly created instrument is registeredwith the Truffle Instrumentation framework, i.e., that it will be automaticallydiscovered by the framework. It also provides some meta-data about theinstrument: id, name, version, which services the instrument provides andwhether the instrument is internal or not. In order for this annotation to beeffective the Truffle DSL processor needs to process this class. This is, in case of Simple Tool, done automatically by having the DSL processor as a dependency in the maven configuration.Now we will look back at the implementation of the SimpleCoverageInstrument class, namely which methods from TruffleInstrument does it override.These are onCreate, onDispose and getOptionDescriptors.The onCreate and onDispose methods are quite self-explanatory: called by the framework when the instrument is created and disposed.We will discuss their implementations later, but first let us discuss the remaining one: getOptionDescriptors.Truffle comes with its own system for specifying command line options.These options allow tool users to control the tool either from the command line or when creating polyglot contexts.It is annotation based, and examples for such options are the ENABLED and PRINT_COVERAGE fields of SimpleCoverageInstrument.Both of these are static final fields of the type OptionKey annotated with Option which, similarly to the Registration annotation, provides some meta data for the option.Again, as with the Registration annotation, for the Option annotation to be effective the Truffle DSL processor is needed, which generates a subclass of OptionDescriptors (in our case named SimpleCoverageInstrumentOptionDescriptors).An instance of this class should be returned from the getOptionDescriptors method to let the framework know which options the instrument provides.Let us return to the onCreate method. As an argument we receive an instance of the Env class.This object gives a lot of useful information, but for the onCreate method we are primarily interested in the getOptions method, which can be used to read which options are passed to the tool.We use this to check whether the ENABLED option has been set and if so we enable our tool by calling the enable method.Similarly, in the onDispose method we check the options for the state of the PRINT_COVERAGE option, and if it is enabled we call the printResults method which will print our results.What does it mean “to enable a tool”?In general, it means that we tell the framework about the events we areinterested in and how we want to react to them. Looking at our enablemethod it does the following:  Firstly, it defines SourceSectionFilter.This filter is a declarative definition of the parts of the source code we areinterested in. In our example, we care about all nodes that are consideredexpressions, and we do not care about internal language parts.  Secondly, we obtain a instance of anInstrumenterclass which is an object allowing to specify which parts of the system we wishto instrument.  Finally, using the Instrumenter class, we specify a Source Section Listener and an Execution Event Factory which are both described in the next two sections.Source Section ListenerTruffle API provides the notion of a Source which is the source code unit, and a SourceSection which is one continuous part of a Source, e.g., one method, one statement, one expression, and so on. More details can be found in the respective javadoc.The first requirement for Simple Tool is to keep track of loaded source code.The Truffle Instrumentation API provides the LoadSourceSectionListener which, when subclassed and registered with the instrumenter, allows to react to the runtime loading source sections.This is exactly what we do with the GatherSourceSectionsListener, which is registered in the enable method of the instrument.The implementation of GatherSourceSectionsListener is quite simple: we override the onLoad method to notify the instrument of each loaded source section.The instrument keeps a mapping from each Source to a Coverage object which keeps a set of loaded source sections for each source.Execution Event NodeTruffle languages are implemented as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) interpreters.The language implementers annotate certain nodes with tags, which allows toselect which nodes we are interested in, by using the aforementionedSourceSectionFilter, in a language agnostic manner. The main power of theTruffle Instrumentation framework lies in its ability to insert specialisednodes in the AST which “wrap” the nodes of interest. These nodes are built usingthe same infrastructure that the language developers use, and are, from theperspective of the runtime, indistinguishable from the language nodes. Thismeans that all the techniques used to optimize Truffle languages into such highperforming language implementations are available to the tool developers aswell. More information about these techniques is available in the language implementation documentation.Suffice it to say that for Simple Tool to meet its second requirement, we need toinstrument all expressions with our own node that will notify when thatexpression is executed.For this task we use the CoverageNode.It is a subclass of ExecutionEventNode which, as the name implies, is used to instrument events during execution.The ExecutionEventNode offers many methods to override, but we are only interested in onReturnValue.This method is invoked when the “wrapped” node returns a value, i.e. is successfully executed.The implementation is rather simple. We just notify the instrument that the node with this particular SourceSection has been executed, and the instrument updates the Coverage object in its coverage map.The instrument is notified only once per node, as the logic is guarded by the flag.The fact that this flag is annotated with CompilationFinal and that the calls to the instrument is preceded by a call to transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate() is a standard technique in Truffle which ensures that once this instrumentation is no longer needed (i.e. a node has been executed) the instrumentation is removed from further compilations removing with it any performance overhead.In order for the framework to know how to instantiate the CoverageNode when itis needed we need to provide a factory for them.The factory is the CoverageEventFactory, a subclass of ExecutionEventNodeFactory.This class just ensures that each CoverageNode knows the SourceSection it is instrumenting by looking it up in the provided EventContext.Finally, when we are enabling the instrument,we tell the instrumenter to use our factory to “wrap” the nodes selected by ourfilter.Interaction Between Users and InstrumentsThe third and final requirement Simple Tool has is to actually interact with its user by printing line coverage to standard output.The instrument overriders the onDispose method which is unsurprisingly called when the instrument is being disposed of.In this method we check that the proper option has been set and, if so, calculate and print the coverage as recorded by our map of Coverage objects.This is a simple way of providing useful information to a user, but it is definitely not the only one.A tool could dump its data directly to a file, or run a web endpoint which shows the information, etc..One of the mechanisms that the Truffle Instrumentation framework provides users is registering instruments as services to be looked up by other instruments.If we look at the Registration annotation of our instrument we can see that it provides a services field where we can specify which services the instrument provides to other instruments.These services need to be explicitly registered.This allows a nicer separation of concerns among instruments so that, for example, we could have a “real time coverage” instrument which would use our SimpleCoverageInstrument to provide on demand coverage information to a user through a REST API, and a “aborts on low coverage” instrument which stops the execution if coverage drops bellow a threshold, both using the SimpleCoverageInstrument as a service.Note that, for reasons of isolation, instrument services are not available to application code, and instrument services can only be used from other instruments or Truffle languages.Installing a Tool into GraalVMSo far, Simple Tool seems to meet all requirements but the question remains: how do we use it?As mentioned before, Simple Tool is a maven project.Setting JAVA_HOME to a GraalVM installation and running mvn package produces a target/simpletool-&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;.jar.This is the Simple Tool distribution form.The Truffle framework offers a clear separation between the language/tooling code and the application code.For this reason, putting the jar on the class path will not result in the framework realizing a new tool is needed.To achieve this we use --vm.Dtruffle.class.path.append=/path/to/simpletool-20.1.0.jar as is illustrated in a launcher script for our simple tool.This script also shows we can set the CLI options we specified for Simple Tool.This means that if we execute ./simpletool js example.js, we will launch the js launcher of GraalVM, add the tool to the Truffle class path, and run the included example.js file with Simple Tool enabled resulting in the following output:==Coverage of /path/to/simpletool/example.js is 59.42%+ var N = 2000;+ var EXPECTED = 17393;

Coverage Instrument: A coverage tool example which was used to build up Simple Tool. It is used as the running example in further text where appropriate.  Debugger Instrument: A sketch on how a debugger can be implemented. Please note that Truffle already provides a Debugger Instrument that can be used directly.  Statement Profiler: A profiler that is able to profile the execution of statements.Instrumentation Event ListenersThe Truffle Instrument application programming interface is defined in the com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation package. Instrumentation agents can be developed by extending the TruffleInstrument class, and can be attached to a running GraalVM instance using in the Instrumenter class. Once attached to a running language runtime, instrumentation agents remain usable as long as the language runtime is not disposed. Instrumentation agents on GraalVM can monitor a variety of VM-level runtime events, including any of the following:  Source code-related events: the agent can be notified every time a new Source or SourceSection element is loaded by the monitored language runtime.  Allocation events: the agent can be notified every time a new object is allocated in the memory space of the monitored language runtime.  Language runtime and thread creation events: the agent can be notified as soon as a new execution context or a new thread for a monitored language runtime is created.  Application execution events: the agent gets notified every time a monitored application executes a specific set of language operations. Examples of such operations include language statements and expressions, thus allowing an instrumentation agent to inspect running applications with very high precision.For each execution event, instrumentation agents can define filtering criteria that will be used by the GraalVM instrumentation runtime to monitor only the relevant execution events. Currently, GraalVM instruments accept one of the following two filter types:  AllocationEventFilter to filter allocation events by allocation type.  SourceSectionFilter to filter source code locations in an application.Filters can be created using the provided builder object. For example, the following builder creates a SourceSectionFilter:SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder()                   .tagIs(StandardTag.StatementTag)                   .mimeTypeIs(&quot;x-application/js&quot;)                   .build()The filter in the example can be used to monitor the execution of all JavaScript statements in a given application. Other filtering options such as line numbers or file extensions can also be provided.Source section filters like the one in the example can use Tags to specify a set of execution events to be monitored. Language-agnostic tags such as statements and expressions are defined in the com.oracle.truffle.api.instrumentation.Tag class, and are supported by all GraalVM languages. In addition to standard tags, GraalVM languages may provide other, language-specific, tags to enable fine-grained profiling of language-specific events (as an example, the GraalVM JavaScript engine provides JavaScript-specific tags to track the usages of ECMA builtin objects such as Array, Map, or Math).Monitoring execution eventsApplication execution events enable very precise and detailed monitoring. GraalVM supports two different types of instrumentation agents to profile such events, namely:  Execution listener: an instrumentation agent that can be notified every time a given runtime event happens. Listeners implement the ExecutionEventListener interface, and cannot associate any state with source code locations.  Execution event node: an instrumentation agent that can be expressed using Truffle Framework AST nodes. Such agents extend the ExecutionEventNode class and have the same capabilities of an execution listener, but can associate state with source code locations.Simple Instrumentation AgentA simple example of a custom instrumentation agent to perform runtime code coverage can be found in the CoverageExample class. What follows is an overview of the agent, of its design, and of its capabilities.All instruments extend the TruffleInstrument abstract class, and are registered in the GraalVM runtime through the @Registration annotation:@Registration(id = CoverageExample.ID, services = Object.class)public final class CoverageExample extends TruffleInstrument {  @Override  protected void onCreate(final Env env) {  }  /* Other methods omitted... */}Instruments override the onCreate(Env env) method to perform custom operations at instrument loading time. Typically, an instrument would use this method to register itself in the existing GraalVM execution environment. As an example, an instrument using AST nodes can be registered in the following way:@Overrideprotected void onCreate(final Env env) {  SourceSectionFilter.Builder builder = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder();  SourceSectionFilter filter = builder.tagIs(EXPRESSION).build();  Instrumenter instrumenter = env.getInstrumenter();  instrumenter.attachExecutionEventFactory(filter, new CoverageEventFactory(env));}The instrument connects itself to the running GraalVM using the attachExecutionEventFactory method, providing the following two arguments:  SourceSectionFilter: a source section filter used to inform the GraalVM about specific code sections to be tracked.  ExecutionEventNodeFactory: a Truffle Framework AST factory that provides instrumentation AST nodes to be executed by the agent every time a runtime event (as specified by the source filter) is executed.A basic ExecutionEventNodeFactory that instruments the AST nodes of an application can be implemented in the following way:public ExecutionEventNode create(final EventContext ec) {  return new ExecutionEventNode() {    @Override    public void onReturnValue(VirtualFrame vFrame, Object result) {      /*       * Code to be executed every time a filtered source code       * element is evaluated by the guest language.       */    }  };}Execution event nodes can implement certain callback methods to intercept runtime execution events. Examples include:  onEnter: executed before an AST node corresponding to a filtered source code element (e.g., a language statement or an expression) is evaluated.  onReturnValue: executed after a source code element returns a value.  onReturnExceptional: executed in case the filtered source code element throws an exception.Execution event nodes are created on a per code location basis. Therefore, they can be used to store data specific to a given source code location in the instrumented application. As an example, an instrumentation node can simply keep track of all code locations that have already been visited using a node-local flag. Such a node-local boolean flag can be used to track the execution of AST nodes in the following way:// To keep track of all source code locations executedprivate final Set&amp;lt;SourceSection&amp;gt; coverage = new HashSet&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();public ExecutionEventNode create(final EventContext ec) {  return new ExecutionEventNode() {    // Per-node flag to keep track of execution for this node    @CompilationFinal private boolean visited = false;    @Override    public void onReturnValue(VirtualFrame vFrame, Object result) {      if (!visited) {        CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreterAndInvalidate();        visited = true;        SourceSection src = ec.getInstrumentedSourceSection();        coverage.add(src);      }    }  };}As the above code shows, an ExecutionEventNode is a valid AST node. This implies that the instrumentation code will be optimized by the GraalVM together with the instrumented application, resulting in minimal instrumentation overhead. Furthermore, this allows instrument developers to use Truffle Framework compiler directives directly from instrumentation nodes. In the example, compiler directives are used to inform the GraalVM compiler that visited can be considered compilation-final.Each instrumentation node is bound to a specific code location. Such locations can be accessed by the agent using the provided EventContext object.The context object gives instrumentation nodes access to a variety of information about the current AST nodes being executed. Examples of query APIs available to instrumentation agents through EventContext include:  hasTag to query an instrumented node for a certain node Tag (e.g., to check if a statement node is also a conditional node).  getInstrumentedSourceSection to access the SourceSection associated with the current node.  getInstrumentedNode to access the Node corresponding to the current instrumentation event.Fine-grained expression profilingInstrumentation agents can profile even fractional events such as language expressions. To this end, an agent needs to be initialized providing two source section filters:// What source sections are we interested in?SourceSectionFilter sourceSectionFilter = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder().tagIs(JSTags.BinaryOperation.class).build();// What generates input data to track?SourceSectionFilter inputGeneratingLocations = SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder().tagIs(                        StandardTags.ExpressionTag.class).build();instrumenter.attachExecutionEventFactory(sourceSectionFilter, inputGeneratingLocations, factory);The first source section filter (sourceSectionFilter, in the example) is a normal filter equivalent to other filters described before, and is used to identify the source code locations to be monitored. The second section filter, inputGeneratingLocations, is used by the agent to specify the intermediate values that should be monitored for a certain source section. Intermediate values correspond to all observable values that are involved in the execution of a monitored code element, and are reported to the instrumentation agent by means of the onInputValue callback. As an example, let us assume an agent needs to profile all operand values provided to sum operations (i.e., +) in JavaScript:var a = 3;var b = 4;// the &#39;+&#39; expression is profiledvar c = a + b;By filtering on JavaScript Binary expressions, an instrumentation agent would be able to detect the following runtime events for the above code snippet:  onEnter() for the binary expression at line 3.  onInputValue() for the first operand of the binary operation at line 3. The value reported by the callback will be 3, that is, the value of the a local variable.  onInputValue() for the second operand of the binary operation. The value reported by the callback will be 4, that is, the value of the b local variable.  onReturnValue() for the binary expression. The value provided to the callback will be the value returned by the expression after it has completed its evaluation, that is, the value 7.By extending the source section filters to all possible events, an instrumentation agent will observe something equivalent to the following execution trace (in pseudocode):// First variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - NumericLiteral    onReturnValue - NumericLiteral  onInputValue - (3)onReturnValue - VariableWrite// Second variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - NumericLiteral    onReturnValue - NumericLiteral  onInputValue - (4)onReturnValue - VariableWrite// Third variable declarationonEnter - VariableWrite    onEnter - BinaryOperation        onEnter - VariableRead        onReturnValue - VariableRead      onInputValue - (3)        onEnter - VariableRead        onReturnValue - VariableRead      onInputValue - (4)    onReturnValue - BinaryOperation  onInputValue - (7)onReturnValue - VariableWriteThe onInputValue method can be used in combination with source section filters to intercept very fine-grained execution events such as intermediate values used by language expressions. The intermediate values that are accessible to the Instrumentation framework greatly depend on the instrumentation support provided by each language. Moreover, languages may provide additional metadata associated with language-specific Tag classes.Altering the execution flow of an applicationThe instrumentation capabilities that we have presented so far enable users to observe certain aspects of a running application. In addition to passive monitoring of an application’s behavior, the Instrument API features support for actively altering the behavior of an application at runtime. Such capabilities can be used to write complex instrumentation agents that affect the behavior of a running application to achieve specific runtime semantics. For example, one could alter the semantics of a running application to ensure that certain methods or functions are never executed (e.g., by throwing an exception when they are called).Instrumentation agents with such capabilities can be implemented by leveraging the onUnwind callback in execution event listeners and factories. As an example, let’s consider the following JavaScript code:function inc(x) {  return x + 1}var a = 10var b = a;// Let&#39;s call inc() with normal semanticswhile (a == b &amp;amp;&amp;amp; a &amp;lt; 100000) {  a = inc(a);  b = b + 1;}c = a;// Run inc() and alter it&#39;s return type using the instrumentreturn inc(c)An instrumentation agent that modifies the return value of inc to always be 42 can be implemented using an ExecutionEventListener, in the following way:ExecutionEventListener myListener = new ExecutionEventListener() {  @Override  public void onReturnValue(EventContext context, VirtualFrame frame, Object result) {    String callSrc = context.getInstrumentedSourceSection().getCharacters();    // is this the function call that we want to modify?    if (&quot;inc(c)&quot;.equals(callSrc)) {      CompilerDirectives.transferToInterpreter();      // notify the runtime that we will change the current execution flow      throw context.createUnwind(null);    }  }  @Override  public Object onUnwind(EventContext context, VirtualFrame frame, Object info) {    // just return 42 as the return value for this node    return 42;  }}The event listener can be executed intercepting all function calls, for example using the following instrument:@TruffleInstrument.Registration(id = &quot;UniversalAnswer&quot;, services = UniversalAnswerInstrument.class)public static class UniversalAnswerInstrument extends TruffleInstrument {  @Override  protected void onCreate(Env env) {    env.registerService(this);    env.getInstrumenter().attachListener(SourceSectionFilter.newBuilder().tagIs(CallTag.class).build(), myListener);  }}When enabled, the instrument will execute its onReturnValue callback each time a function call returns. The callback reads the associated source section (using getInstrumentedSourceSection) and looks for a specific source code pattern (the function call inc(c), in this case). As soon as such code pattern is found, the instrument throws a special runtime exception, called UnwindException, that instructs the Instrumentation framework about a change in the current application’s execution flow. The exception is intercepted by the onUnwind callback of the instrumentation agent, which can be used to return any arbitrary value to the original instrumented application. In the example, all calls to inc(c) will return 42 regardless of any application-specific data. A more realistic instrument might access and monitor several aspects of an application, and might not rely on source code locations, but rather on object instances or other application-specific data.",

                    "content": "Introduction to SimpleLanguageWe found the easiest way to get started with implementing your own language byextending an existing SimpleLanguage.SimpleLanguage is a demonstrationlanguage built using the Truffle API.The SimpleLanguage project provides a showcase on how to use the Truffle APIsfor writing your own language. It aims to use most of the available Truffleframework features and documents their use extensively with inline sourcedocumentation.To start, please ensure maven3 andGraalVM are available in yoursystem.  Clone the SimpleLanguage repository using    $ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage    Set the JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables to the GraalVM home and bin folders using a command-line shell for Linux:    $ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/graalvm$ export PATH=/path/to/graalvm/bin:$PATH    and for macOS X:    $ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/graalvm/Contents/Home$ export PATH=/path/to/graalvm/Contents/Home/bin:$PATH    Execute mvn package from SimpleLanguage folder to build the language.The command also builds a slnative executable in the simplelanguage/nativedirectory and sl-component.jar language component which later can be installedinto GraalVM using the GraalVMUpdater tool.Please verify if native-image plugin is available in your GraalVM distributionto avoid the build failure:    $ gu list$ gu install native-image    You can disable the SimpleLanguage native image build during the packaging phase by running:    $ export SL_BUILD_NATIVE=false$ mvn package    Run in the simplelanguage root folder:    $ ./sl ./language/tests/HelloWorld.sl  The SimpleLanguage demonstration language is licensed under the Universal Permissive License (UPL).IDE SetupThe Truffle Language Implementation framework provides language-agnostic infrastructure to realize standard IDE features by providing additional APIs. If you would like to experiment with your language and get the benefits of an IDE, consider the import of SimpleLanguage as an example.EclipseThe SimpleLanguage teaching project has been tested with Eclipse Neon.2 Release 4.6.2 and Eclipse Oxygen.3A. To import the project folder to the desirable Eclipse environment:  Open Eclipse with a new workspace;  Install m2e and m2e-apt plugins from the Eclipse marketplace (Help -&amp;gt; Eclipse Marketplace);  Finally, import SimpleLanguage project from File -&amp;gt; Import -&amp;gt; Maven -&amp;gt; Existing Maven Projects -&amp;gt; browse to the simplelanguage folder -&amp;gt; Finish.NetbeansNetBeans provides GUI support for debugging arbitrary languages. In order to upload SimpleLanguage to NetBeans interface, proceed to File -&amp;gt; Open Project -&amp;gt; select simplelanguage folder -&amp;gt; check “Open Required Projects” -&amp;gt; open Project.IntelliJ IDEASimpleLanguage project has been tested with IntelliJ IDEA 2018.3. Open IntelliJ IDEA and, from the main menu bar, select  File -&amp;gt; Open -&amp;gt; Navigate to and select the simplelanguage folder -&amp;gt; Press “OK”.  All dependencies will be included automatically.Run SimpleLanguageTo run a SimpleLanguage source file, execute$ ./sl language/tests/HelloWorld.slTo see assembly code for Truffle compiled functions, run$ ./sl -disassemble language/tests/SumPrint.slDump GraphsTo investigate performance issues, we recommend the Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV) – an essential tool for any language implementer building ontop of GraalVM Enterprise Edition.It is available as a separate download on Oracle Technology Network Downloads page and requires accepting the Oracle Technology Network Developer License.1.Unzip the downloaded package, enter the bin directory and start IGV:$ cd idealgraphvisualizer/bin$ idealgraphvisualizer2.Execute the following from simplelanguage root folder to dump graphs to IGV:$ ./sl -dump language/tests/SumPrint.slDebugTo start debugging the SimpleLanguage implementation with a Java debugger, pass the -debug option to the command-line launcher of your program:$ ./sl -debug language/tests/HelloWorld.slThen attach a Java remote debugger (like Eclipse) on port 8000.SimpleLanguage Component for GraalVMLanguages implemented with Truffle Language Implementation framework can be packaged as Components which later can be installed intoGraalVM using the GraalVM Updater.Running mvn package in the simplelanguage folder also builds asl-component.jar.This file is the SimpleLanguage component for GraalVM and can be installed byrunning:$ gu -L install /path/to/sl-component.jarSimpleLanguage Native ImageA language implementation built with the Truffle Language Implementation framework can be AOTcompiled using the GraalVM Native Image. Runningmvn package in the simplelanguage folder also builds a slnative executablein the native directory. This executable is the full SimpleLanguageimplementation as a single native application, and has no need for a GraalVM inorder to execute SimpleLanguage code. Besides this, a big advantage of using thenative image when compared to running on the GraalVM is the greatly fasterstartup time as shown bellow.$ time ./sl language/tests/HelloWorld.sl== running on org.graalvm.polyglot.Engine@2db0f6b2Hello World!real    0m0.405suser    0m0.660ssys     0m0.108s$ time ./native/slnativelanguage/tests/HelloWorld.sl== running on org.graalvm.polyglot.Engine@7fd046f06898Hello World!real    0m0.004suser    0m0.000ssys     0m0.000sThis snipped shows a timed execution of a “Hello World” program using the sllauncher script, which runs SimpleLanguage on GraalVM, and using the nativeimage. We can see that when running on GraalVM the execution takes 405ms. Sinceour SimpleLanguage program does just one print statement, we can conclude thatalmost all of this time is spent starting up GraalVM and initializing thelanguage itself. When using the native image we see that the execution takesonly 4ms, showing two orders of magnitude faster startup than running on theGraalVM.For more information on the native-image tool consider reading the reference manual.Disable SimpleLanguage Native Image BuildBuilding the native image through maven is attached to the maven packagephase. Since the native image build can take a bit of time, we provide theoption to skip this build by setting the SL_BUILD_NATIVE environment variableto false like so:$ export SL_BUILD_NATIVE=false$ mvn package...[INFO]                                                                         [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------[INFO] Building simplelanguage-graalvm-native[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------[INFO][INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec (make_native) @ simplelanguage-graalvm-native ---Skipping the native image build because SL_BUILD_NATIVE is set to false.[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------...Run SimpleLanguage with the Newest Compiler VersionIn the outstanding case that you need to execute SimpleLanguage with the newestversion of the GraalVM compiler, please follow these instructions:  Download the latest JVMCI JDK 8 and point JAVA_HOME at it:    $ export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/openjdk1.8.0_242-jvmci-20.1-b01    Clone the “Graal” repository from SimpleLanguage folder:    $ cd /path/to/simplelanguage$ git clone https://github.com/oracle/graal.git    Clone the mx repository:    $ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git    Add mx to your path:    $ export PATH=/path/to/mx:$PATH    Navigate to the compiler folder:    $ cd /path/to/graal/compiler    Build the GraalVM compiler:    $ mx build    Run SimpleLanguage using the mx command:    $ mx -v --jdk=jvmci vm -cp /path/to/simplelanguage/launcher/target/launcher-20.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:/path/to/simplelanguage/language/target/simplelanguage.jar com.oracle.truffle.sl.launcher.SLMain  /path/to/simplelanguage/language/tests/SlScript.sl  Run SimpleLanguage Using Command LineExecuting SimpleLanguage code is normally done with the sl script which setsup the necessary command line depending on whether JAVA_HOME points to theGraalVM or another JVM installation. The following subsections describe thecommand line for both cases.GraalVMAssuming JAVA_HOME points to the GraalVM installation and that the currentworking directory is the simplelanguage directory, to run SimpleLanguage oneshould execute the following command:$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java     -cp launcher/target/launcher-20.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar     -Dtruffle.class.path.append=language/target/simplelanguage.jar     com.oracle.truffle.sl.launcher.SLMain language/tests/Add.slIn short, we place the launcher jar on the class path and execute its mainclass, but we inform GraalVM of the presence of SimpleLanguage by using the-Dtruffle.class.path.append option and providing it the path to the fatlanguage jar. Having the language on a separate class path ensures a strongseparation between the language implementation and its embedding context (inthis case, the launcher).Disable Class Path SeparationNOTE! This should only be used during development.If it is required to disable the class path separation and enable having thelanguage implementation on the application class path (for example, for testingthe internals of the language) you can add the -XX:-UseJVMCIClassLoaderoption. This disables the class path isolation, enabling the languageimplementation to be placed on the application class path. The command line canthen look like the following.$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java     -XX:-UseJVMCIClassLoader -Dgraalvm.locatorDisabled=true     -cp launcher/target/launcher-20.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:language/target/simplelanguage.jar     com.oracle.truffle.sl.launcher.SLMain language/tests/Add.slOther JVM ImplementationsUnlike GraalVM, which includes all the dependencies needed to run a languageimplemented with Truffle framework, other JVM implementations need additionaljars to be present on the class path. These are the Truffle API and GraalVM SDKjars available from Maven Central.Assuming JAVA_HOME points to a Stock JDK installation, that the currentworking directory is the simplelanguage directory and the Truffle API andGraalVM SDK jars are present in that directory, one can execute SimpleLanguagewith the following command:$ $JAVA_HOME/bin/java     -cp graal-sdk-20.1.0.jar:truffle-api-20.1.0.jar:launcher/target/launcher-20.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:language/target/simplelanguage.jar     com.oracle.truffle.sl.launcher.SLMain language/tests/Add.sl",

If you are attempting to experiment with deploying TruffleRuby to production wewould encourage you to contact us so we can help you understand what is possible atthe moment and to help solve any issues for you.TruffleRuby repositoryThe TruffleRuby project is open source and located on GitHub: oracle/truffleruby. If you encounter any issues or want to leave feedback or feature requests please create an issue in this repository.Installing RubyTruffleRuby can be installed to a GraalVM build with the functional gu utility:gu install rubyThe above command will install a community version of a component from GitHub catalog.For GraalVM Enterprise users, the manual component installation is required. See bin/gu --help for more information.Running Ruby applicationsRun Ruby applications with the standard ruby command:$ ruby [options] program.rbOther Ruby commands are available, including gem, irb, rake, rdoc,and ri.TruffleRuby uses thesame options as the standard implementation of Ruby with some additions.Installing a Ruby gem$ gem install chunky_png$ ruby -r chunky_png -e &quot;puts ChunkyPNG::Color.to_hex(ChunkyPNG::Color(&#39;mintcream @ 0.5&#39;))&quot;#f5fffa80What does TruffleRuby do?Run idiomatic Ruby code fasterTruffleRuby in conjunction with the GraalVM produces very fast machine code.Traditionally, performance-critical Ruby code has had to be extracted out tolanguage extensions implemented in native code. This approach is cumbersome anderror-prone. TruffleRuby on the GraalVM is able to optimize Ruby code. Moreimportantly, it can optimize idiomatic Ruby code.The following example template rendering benchmark is taken from theMRI benchmark suite.It has been modified to work with the benchmark-ips benchmarking harness,and to write the result of the render to a file in order to include IO.require &#39;benchmark/ips&#39;require &#39;erb&#39;data = &amp;lt;&amp;lt;erb&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;%= title %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;h1&amp;gt; &amp;lt;%= title %&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;%= content %&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;erbtitle = &#39;hello world!&#39;content = &quot;hello world!n&quot; * 10erb = ERB.new(data)out = File.open(&#39;test.out&#39;, &#39;w&#39;)Benchmark.ips do |x|  x.iterations = 3  x.report(&quot;erb&quot;) { out.write(erb.result(binding)) }end$ gem install benchmark-ips$ ruby benchmark.rb            MRI 2.5.3      JRuby 9.2.5.0      TruffleRuby  CE native      TruffleRuby  EE JVM                  34 K renders/s      29 K renders/s      542 K renders/s  (16x faster)      1 M renders/s  (31x faster)      Run Ruby code in parallelTruffleRuby runs threads in parallel, without a global-interpreter-lock. Itincludes sophisticated techniques to automatically make objects thread-safe onlywhen they are going to be used by more than one thread, leaving themunsynchronized when used from only one thread to give you parallelism without anoverhead when you do not want to use it.Boot Ruby applications in less timeA hello-world script in TruffleRuby runs about as fast as MRI, or over ten timesfaster than JRuby. TruffleRuby can run without a heavy-weight JVM so that youstart running your Ruby code almost immediately.Execute C extensions in a managed environmentTruffleRuby executes C extensions using a managed C interpreter and just-in-timecompiler, not by running native code.Provide new toolingTruffleRuby includes a built-in debugger that allows you to use Chrome DevToolson your Ruby application.$ ruby --inspect test.rbDebugger listening on port 9229.To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:    chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?ws=127.0.0.1:9229/ffffffffffffffff-fffffffffffffffffAdd fast and low-overhead interoperabilityTruffleRuby allows you to write polyglot programs using the other languages fromGraalVM.High compatibility with the standard implementation of RubyTruffleRuby aims to be fully compatible with the standard implementation ofRuby, MRI, version 2.6.5. We test extensively using the MRItest suite and the Ruby Spec project.InteroperabilityGraalVM supports several other programming languages, including JavaScript, R,Python, and LLVM. TruffleRuby lets you run code from these languages, and useobjects and methods from one language in another.As an example, we can pass a JSON-encoded string into Graal.js, decode it intoa JavaScript object, and then inspect the decoded object in Ruby:require &#39;json&#39;obj = {  time: Time.now,  msg: &#39;Hello World&#39;,  payload: (1..10).to_a}encoded = JSON.dump(obj)js_obj = Polyglot.eval(&#39;js&#39;, &#39;JSON.parse&#39;).call(encoded)puts js_obj[:time]puts js_obj[:msg]puts js_obj[:payload].join(&#39; &#39;)We use the --jvm --polyglot option to say we want to run a polyglot program.$ ruby --jvm --polyglot test.rb2018-04-11 15:25:08 -0700Hello World1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10CompatibilityTruffleRuby aims to be fully compatible with the standard implementation ofRuby, MRI, version 2.6.5.Any incompatibility with MRI is considered a bug, except for rare cases detailed below.If you find an incompatibility with MRI, please report it to us.Our policy is to match the behaviour of MRI, except where we do not know how todo so with good performance for typical Ruby programs. Some features work butwill have very low performance whenever they are used and we advise againstusing them on TruffleRuby if you can. Some features are missing entirely and maynever be implemented. In a few limited cases, we are deliberately incompatiblewith MRI in order to provide a greater capability.In general, we are not looking to debate whether Ruby features are good, bad, orif we could design the language better. If we can support a feature, we will do.In the future, we aim to provide compatibility with extra functionality providedby JRuby, but at the moment we do not.IdentificationTruffleReport defines these constants for identification:  RUBY_ENGINE is &#39;truffleruby&#39;  RUBY_VERSION is the compatible MRI version  RUBY_REVISION is the compatible MRI version revision  RUBY_PATCHLEVEL is always zero  RUBY_RELEASE_DATE is the Git commit date  RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION is the GraalVM version, or 0.0- and the Git commit hash if your build is not part of a GraalVM release.Additionally, TruffleRuby defines:  TruffleRuby.revision which is the Git commit hashIn the C API, we define a preprocessor macro TRUFFLERUBY.Features entirely missingContinuations and callccContinuations and callcc are unlikely to ever be implemented in TruffleRuby,as their semantics fundamentally do not match the technology that we are using.ForkYou cannot fork the TruffleRuby interpreter. The feature is unlikely to everbe supported when running on the JVM but could be supported in the future inthe native configuration. The correct and portable way to test if fork isavailable is:Process.respond_to?(:fork)Standard librariesThe following standard libraries are unsupported.  continuation  dbm  gdbm  sdbm  debug (could be implemented in the future, use --inspect instead)  profile (could be implemented in the future, use --cpusampler instead)  profiler (could be implemented in the future, use --cpusampler instead)  io/console (partially implemented, could be implemented in the future)  io/wait (partially implemented, could be implemented in the future)  pty (could be implemented in the future)  ripper (has a no-op implementation, and could be implemented in the future)  win32  win32olefiddle is not yet implemented - the module and some methods are therebut not enough to run anything serious.We provide our own included implementation of the interface of the ffi gem,like JRuby and Rubinius. The implementation should be fairly complete and passesall the specs of the ffi gem except for some rarely-used corner cases.Safe levels$SAFE and Thread#safe_level are 0 and no other levels are implemented.Trying to use level 1 will raise a SecurityError. Other levels will raiseArgumentError as in standard Ruby. See our security notes formore explanation on this.Internal MRI functionalityRubyVM is not intended for users and is not implemented.RDoc HTML generationTruffleRuby does not include the Darkfish theme for RDoc.Features with major differencesThreads run in parallelIn MRI, threads are scheduled concurrently but not in parallel. In TruffleRubythreads are scheduled in parallel. As in JRuby and Rubinius, you are responsiblefor correctly synchronising access to your own shared mutable data structures,and we will be responsible for correctly synchronising the state of theinterpreter.Threads detect interrupts at different pointsTruffleRuby threads may detect that they have been interrupted at differentpoints in the program to where it would on MRI. In general, TruffleRuby seemsto detect an interrupt sooner than MRI. JRuby and Rubinius are also differentto MRI, the behaviour is not documented in MRI, and it is likely to changebetween MRI versions, so we would not recommend depending on interrupt pointsat all.Fibers do not have the same performance characteristics as in MRIMost use cases of fibers rely on them being easy and cheap to start up andhaving low memory overheads. In TruffleRuby we implement fibers using operatingsystem threads, so they have the same performance characteristics as Rubythreads. As with coroutines and continuations, a conventional implementationof fibers fundamentally is not compatible with the execution model we arecurrently using.Some classes marked as internal will be differentMRI provides some classes that are described in the documentation as being onlyavailable on MRI (C Ruby). We implement these classes if it is practical to doso, but this is not always the case. For example RubyVM is not available.Features with subtle differencesCommand line switches-y, --yydebug, --dump=, --debug-frozen-string-literal are ignored witha warning as they are unsupported development tools.Programs passed in -e arguments with magic-comments must have an encoding thatis UTF-8 or a subset of UTF-8, as the JVM has already decoded arguments by thetime we get them.--jit options and the jit feature are not supported because TruffleRubyuses the GraalVM compiler as a JIT.Time is limited to millisecond precisionRuby normally provides microsecond (millionths of a second) clock precision,but TruffleRuby is currently limited to millisecond (thousands of a second)precision. This applies to Time.now andProcess.clock_gettime(Process::CLOCK_REALTIME).Setting the process title does not always workSetting the process title (via $0 or Process.setproctitle in Ruby) is doneas best-effort. It may not work, or the title you try to set may be truncated.Line numbers other than 1 work differentlyIn an eval where a custom line number can be specified, line numbers below 1are treated as 1, and line numbers above 1 are implemented by inserting blanklines in front of the source before parsing it.The erb standard library has been modified to not use negative line numbers.Polyglot standard IO streamsIf you use standard IO streams provided by the Polyglot engine, via theexperimental --polyglot-stdio option, reads and writes to file descriptors 1,2 and 3 will be redirected to these streams. That means that other IOoperations on these file descriptors, such as isatty may not be relevant forwhere these streams actually end up, and operations like dup may lose theconnection to the polyglot stream. For example, if you $stdout.reopen, assome logging frameworks do, you will get the native standard-out, not thepolyglot out.Also, IO buffer drains, writes on IO objects with sync set, andwrite_nonblock, will not retry the write on EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, as thestreams do not provide a way to detect this.Error messagesError message strings will sometimes differ from MRI, as these are not generallycovered by the Ruby Specification suite or tests.SignalsThe set of signals that TruffleRuby can handle is different from MRI. Whenlaunched as a GraalVM Native Image, TruffleRuby allows trapping all the samesignals that MRI does, as well as a few that MRI does not. The only signalsthat cannot be trapped are KILL, STOP, and VTALRM. Consequently, anysignal handling code that runs on MRI can run on TruffleRuby without modificationin the GraalVM Native Image.However, when run on the JVM, TruffleRuby is unable to trap USR1 or QUIT,as these are reserved by the JVM itself. Any code that relies on being able totrap those signals will need to fallover to another available signal. Additionally,FPE, ILL, KILL, SEGV, STOP, and VTALRM cannot be trapped, but thesesignals are also unavailable on MRI.When TruffleRuby is run as part of a polyglot application, any signals that arehandled by another language become unavailable for TruffleRuby to trap.Features with very low performanceObjectSpaceUsing most methods on ObjectSpace will temporarily lower the performance ofyour program. Using them in test cases and other similar ‘offline’ operations isfine, but you probably do not want to use them in the inner loop of yourproduction application.set_trace_funcUsing set_trace_func will temporarily lower the performance of your program.As with ObjectSpace, we would recommend that you do not use this in the innerloop of your production application.BacktracesThrowing exceptions, and other operations which need to create a backtrace, areslower than on MRI. This is because we have to undo optimizations that we haveapplied to run your Ruby code fast in order to recreate the backtrace entries.We would not recommend using exceptions for control flow on any implementation ofRuby anyway.To help alleviate this problem in some cases backtraces are automaticallydisabled where we dynamically detect that they probably will not be used. See theexperimental --backtraces-omit-unused option.C Extension CompatibilityVALUE is a pointerIn TruffleRuby VALUE is a pointer type (void *) rather than ainteger type (long). This means that switch statements cannot bedone using a raw VALUE as they can with MRI. You can normallyreplace any switch statement with if statements with littledifficulty if required.Identifiers may be macros or functionsIdentifiers which are normally macros may be functions, functions may be macros,and global variables may be macros. This may cause problems where they are usedin a context which relies on a particular implementation (e.g., taking theaddress of it, assigning to a function pointer variable and using defined() tocheck if a macro exists). These issues should all be considered bugs and befixed, please report these cases.rb_scan_argsrb_scan_args only supports up to ten pointers.RDATAThe mark function of RDATA and RTYPEDDATA is not called duringgarbage collection. Instead we simulate this by caching informationabout objects as they are assigned to structs, and periodically runall mark functions when the cache has become full to represent thoseobject relationships in a way that the our garbage collector willunderstand. The process should behave identically to MRI.Compatibility with JRubyRuby to Java interopTruffleRuby does not support the same interop to Java interface as JRuby does.We provide an alternate polyglot API for interoperating withmultiple languages, including Java, instead.Java to Ruby interopCalling Ruby code from Java is supported by theGraalVM polyglot API.Java extensionsUse Java extensions written for JRuby is not supported. We could apply the sametechniques as we have developed to run C extensions to this problem, but it isnot clear if this will ever be a priority.Compatibility with RubiniusWe do not have any plans at the moment to provide support for Rubinius’extensions to Ruby.Features not yet supported in native configuration  Java interopRunning TruffleRuby in the native configuration is mostly the same as runningon the JVM. There are differences in resource management, as both VMs usedifferent garbage collectors. But, functionality-wise, they are essentially onpar with one another. The big difference is support for Java interop, whichcurrently relies on reflection. TruffleRuby’s implementation of Java interopdoes not work with the GraalVM Native Image Generator’s limited support forruntime reflection.Spec Completeness‘How many specs are there?’ is not a question with an easy precise answer. Thenumber of specs varies for different versions of the Ruby language, differentplatforms, different versions of the specs, and different configurations ofthe specs. The specs for the standard library and C extension API are alsovery uneven and they so can give misleading results.For the command line interface, the language, and the core library specs,which covers the bulk of what TruffleRuby reimplements, this is how many specexamples TruffleRuby runs successfully compared to our compatible version ofMRI running the version of specs from TruffleRuby:  Command line 112 / 136, 82%  Language 2270 / 2332, 97%  Core library 19453 / 20644, 94%Compatibility with gemsYou can use the compatibility checker to find whether the gems you are interested in are tested on GraalVM, whether the tests pass successfully and so on. Additionally, you can drop your Gemfile.lock file into that tool and it will analyze all the gems you are using at once. Note that the processing is done on the client-side, so no information is uploaded to any servers.TruffleRuby Options and Command LineTruffleRuby has the same command line interface as our compatible MRI version.Usage: truffleruby [switches] [--] [programfile] [arguments]  -0[octal]       specify record separator (0, if no argument)  -a              autosplit mode with -n or -p (splits $_ into $F)  -c              check syntax only  -Cdirectory     cd to directory before executing your script  -d, --debug     set debugging flags (set $DEBUG to true)  -e &#39;command&#39;    one line of script. Several -e&#39;s allowed.

You can omit =value to set to true.Available options and documentation can be seen with --help:languages.Additionally set --help:expert and --help:internal to see those categoriesof options. Note: All options are experimental and subject to change at any time.Options can also be set as JVM system properties, where they have a prefixpolyglot.ruby.. For example --vm.Dpolyglot.ruby.cexts.remap=true, or viaany other way of setting JVM system properties. Finally, options can be set asGraalVM polyglot API configuration options.The priority for options is the command line first, then the Graal-SDK polyglotAPI configuration, then system properties last.TruffleRuby options, as well as conventional Ruby options and VM options, canalso bet set in the TRUFFLERUBYOPT and RUBYOPT environment variables, ifrun from the Ruby launcher.-- or the first non-option argument stops processing of TrufflRuby and VMoptions in the same way it stops processing of Ruby arguments.VM optionsTo set options in the underlying VM, use --vm., valid for both the nativeconfiguration and the JVM configuration.For example --vm.Dsystem_property=value or --vm.ea.To set the classpath, use the = notation, rather than two separate arguments.For example --vm.cp=lib.jar or --vm.classpath=lib.jar.Other binary switchesOther binaries, such as irb, gem, and so on, support exactly the sameswitches as in standard Ruby.Determining the TruffleRuby homeTruffleRuby needs to know where to locate files such as the standard library.These are stored in the TruffleRuby home directory.The search priority for finding Ruby home is:  The value of the TruffleRuby home option (i.e., --home=path/to/truffleruby_home).  The home that the Truffle framework reports.  The parent of the directory containing the Ruby launcher executable.If the home option is set, it is used even if it does not appear to be a correcthome location. Other options are tried until one is found that appears to be acorrect home location. If none appears to be correct a warning will be given butthe program will continue and you will not be able to require standardlibraries. You can tell TruffleRuby not to try to find a home at all using theno-home-provided option.Operations ManualIf you are attempting to experiment with deploying TruffleRuby to production wewould encourage you to contact us so we can help you understand what is possibleat the moment and to help solve any issues for you.TruffleRuby configurationsThere are two main configurations of TruffleRuby - Native Image and JVM. It isimportant to understand the different configurations of TruffleRuby, as each hasdifferent capabilities and performance characteristics. You should pick theexecution mode that is appropriate for your application.When distributed as part of GraalVM, TruffleRuby by default runs in the Native Imageconfiguration. In this configuration, TruffleRuby is ahead-of-time compiled to astandalone native executable. This means that you do not need a JVM installed onyour system to use it. The advantage of the native configuration is that itstarts about as fast as MRI,it may use less memory, and it becomes fast in less time than the JVM configuration. The disadvantageof the native configuration is that you cannot use Java tools like VisualVM, youyou cannot use Java interoperability, and peak performance may be lower than on theJVM. The Native Image configuration is used by default, but you can also request itusing --native. To use polyglot programming with the native configuration,you need to use the --polyglot flag.TruffleRuby can also be used in the JVM configuration, where it runs as anormal Java application on the JVM, as any other Java application would. Theadvantage of the JVM configuration is that you can use Java interoperability, andpeak performance may be higher than the Native Image configuration. The disadvantageof the JVM configuration is that it takes much longer to start and to get fast,and may use more memory. The JVM configuration is requested using --jvm.If you are running a short-running program you probably want the default,Native Image, configuration. If you are running a long-running program and want thehighest possible performance you probably want the JVM configuration, by using--jvm.Getting the best startup time performanceTo get the best startup time performance in most cases you want to use thenative configuration, which is the default.Getting the lowest memory footprintTo get the lowest memory footprint you probably initially want to use the nativeconfiguration, but as you get a larger working set of objects you may find thatthe simpler garbage collector and current lack of compressed ordinary objectpointers (OOPS) actually increases your memory footprint and you will be betteroff with the JVM configuration using --jvm to reduce memory use.Getting the best peak performance from TruffleRubyTo get the best peak performance from TruffleRuby for longer-runningapplications we would in most cases recommend the JVM configuration with--jvm.However to reach this peak performance you need to warm-up TruffleRuby, as youdo with most heavily optimizing virtual machines. This is done by running theapplication under load for a period of time. If you monitor the performance (bymeasuring operation time, or response time) you will see it reduce over time andthen probably stabilize.Tuning TruffleRubyTo tune TruffleRuby you will need to consider the options of either your JVM orthe Native Image, and then the Truffle framework, and the GraalVM compiler.TruffleRuby has a large set of options, which you can see with the --help:languagesflag.LoggingRuby application logging and warning works as in the standard implementation ofRuby.For logging of TruffleRuby internals, standard Java logging is used. The logginglevel can be set with --log.level=INFO, =FINEST, or so on.Troubleshooting TruffleRubyNote: The GraalVM implementation of Ruby is experimental and we cannot guarantee it to be bug free. Experimental features mightnever be included in a production version, or might change significantly beforebeing considered production-ready.TruffleRuby uses sophisticated techniques to optimise a Ruby program and its users are strongly encouraged to submit useful bug reports to Truffleruby issues. If you encounter a performance problem, please consider the recommendations in Reporting Performance Problems document  .",

                    "content": "Running LLVM on GraalVMGraalVM provides an implementation of the lli tool to directly executeprograms in LLVM bitcode form.In contrast to static compilation that is normally used for LLVM basedlanguages, LLI first interprets the bitcode and then dynamically compiles thehot parts of the program using the GraalVM compiler. This allows seamlessinteroperability with the dynamic languages supported by GraalVM.Run programs in LLVM bitcode format:lli [LLI Options] [GraalVM Options] [Polyglot Options] filename [program args]Where filename is a single executable that contains LLVM bitcode.Note: LLVM bitcode is platform dependent. The program must be compiled tobitcode for an appropriate platform.Compiling to LLVM BitcodeGraalVM can execute C/C++, Rust, and other languages that can be compiled toLLVM bitcode. As a first step, you have to compile the program to LLVM bitcodeusing an LLVM frontend such as clang. C/C++ code can be compiled to LLVMbitcode using the clang shipped with GraalVM.To install a pre-built LLVM toolchain for GraalVM, execute the followingcommands:$ gu install llvm-toolchain$ export LLVM_TOOLCHAIN=$(lli --print-toolchain-path)Please note, the installation of the LLVM toolchain component is possible only from GitHub catalog for both GraalVM Community and Enterprise users.Here is some example C code named hello.c:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;int main() {    printf(&quot;Hello from GraalVM!n&quot;);    return 0;}You can compile hello.c to an executable with embedded LLVM bitcode as follows:$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang hello.c -o helloYou can then run hello on GraalVM like this:$ lli helloHello from GraalVM!External library dependenciesIf the bitcode file depends on external libraries, GraalVM will automaticallypick up the dependencies from the binary headers.For example:#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;ncurses.h&amp;gt;int main() {    initscr();    printw(&quot;Hello, Curses!&quot;);    refresh();    sleep(1);    endwin();    return 0;}This can be run with:$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang hello-curses.c -lncurses -o hello-curses$ lli hello-cursesRunning C++For running C++ code, the GraalVM LLVM runtime requires thelibc++ standard library from the LLVM project. TheLLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM automatically links against libc++.#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;int main() {    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &quot;Hello, C++ World!&quot; &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::endl;}Compile the code with clang++:$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang++ hello-c++.cpp -o hello-c++$ lli hello-c++Hello, C++ World!Running RustThe LLVM toolchain that is bundled with GraalVM does not come with the Rustcompiler. To install Rust, run the following in your terminal, then follow theonscreen instructions:curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | shHere is an example Rust program:fn main() {    println!(&quot;Hello Rust!&quot;);}This can be compiled to bitcode with the --emit=llvm-bc flag:$ rustc --emit=llvm-bc hello-rust.rsTo run the Rust program, we have to tell GraalVM where to find the Ruststandard libraries.$ lli --lib $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/libstd-* hello-rust.bcHello Rust!InteroperabilityGraalVM supports several other programming languages, including JavaScript,Python, Ruby, and R. While LLI is designed to run LLVM bitcode, it also providesan API for programming language interoperability that lets you execute code fromany other language that GraalVM supports.Dynamic languages like JavaScript usually access object members by name. Sincenormally names are not preserved in LLVM bitcode, it must be compiled with debuginfo enabled (the LLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM will automatically enabledebug info).The following example demonstrates how you can use the API for interoperabilitywith other programming languages.Let us define a C struct for points and implement allocation functions:// cpart.c#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;struct Point {    double x;    double y;};POLYGLOT_DECLARE_STRUCT(Point)void *allocNativePoint() {    struct Point *ret = malloc(sizeof(*ret));    return polyglot_from_Point(ret);}void *allocNativePointArray(int length) {    struct Point *ret = calloc(length, sizeof(*ret));    return polyglot_from_Point_array(ret, length);}void freeNativePoint(struct Point *p) {    free(p);}void printPoint(struct Point *p) {    printf(&quot;Point&amp;lt;%f,%f&amp;gt;n&quot;, p-&amp;gt;x, p-&amp;gt;y);}Make sure LLVM_TOOLCHAIN resolves to the GraalVM LLVM toolchain (lli --print-toolchain-path),then compile cpart.c with (the polyglot-mock library defines the polyglotAPI functions used in the example):$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang -shared cpart.c -lpolyglot-mock -o cpart.soYou can access your C/C++ code from other languages like JavaScript:// jspart.js// Load and parse the LLVM bitcode into GraalVMvar cpart = Polyglot.evalFile(&quot;llvm&quot; ,&quot;cpart.so&quot;);// Allocate a light-weight C structvar point = cpart.allocNativePoint();// Access it as if it were a JS objectpoint.x = 5;point.y = 7;// Pass it back to a native functioncpart.printPoint(point);// We can also allocate an array of structsvar pointArray = cpart.allocNativePointArray(15);// We can access this array like it was a JS arrayfor (var i = 0; i &amp;lt; pointArray.length; i++) {    var p = pointArray[i];    p.x = i;    p.y = 2*i;}cpart.printPoint(pointArray[3]);// We can also pass a JS object to a native functioncpart.printPoint({x: 17, y: 42});// Don&#39;t forget to free the unmanaged data objectscpart.freeNativePoint(point);cpart.freeNativePoint(pointArray);Run this JavaScript file with:$ js --polyglot jspart.jsPoint&amp;lt;5.000000,7.000000&amp;gt;Point&amp;lt;3.000000,6.000000&amp;gt;Point&amp;lt;17.000000,42.000000&amp;gt;Polyglot C APIThere are also lower level API functions for directly accessing polyglot valuesfrom C. See the Polyglot Referenceand the documentation comments in polyglot.h for more details.For example, this program allocates and accesses a Java array from C:#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *arrayType = polyglot_java_type(&quot;int[]&quot;);    void *array = polyglot_new_instance(arrayType, 4);    polyglot_set_array_element(array, 2, 24);    int element = polyglot_as_i32(polyglot_get_array_element(array, 2));    printf(&quot;%dn&quot;, element);    return element;}Compile it to LLVM bitcode:$ $LLVM_TOOLCHAIN/clang polyglot.c -lpolyglot-mock -o polyglotAnd run it, using the --jvm argument to run GraalVM in the JVM mode, since we areusing a Java type:$ lli --jvm polyglot24Embedding in JavaGraalVM can also be used to embed LLVM bitcode in Java host programs.For example, let us write a Java class Polyglot.java that embeds GraalVM torun the previous example:import java.io.*;import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class Polyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().                       allowAllAccess(true).build();        File file = new File(&quot;polyglot&quot;);        Source source = Source.newBuilder(&quot;llvm&quot;, file).build();        Value cpart = polyglot.eval(source);        cpart.execute();    }}Compiling and running it:$ javac Polyglot.java$ java Polyglot24See the Embedding documentationfor more information.Source-Level DebuggingYou can use GraalVM’s Debugger to debug the programyou compiled to LLVM bitcode.To use this feature, please make sure to compile your program with debug information by specifying the -gargument when compiling with clang (the LLVM toolchain shipped with GraalVM will automatically enabledebug info). This gives you the ability to step through the program’s source code and set breakpoints in it.With GraalVM 20.0 and older, the option --llvm.enableLVI=true is needed for being able to inspect variablesduring debugging. This option is not enabled by default as it decreases the program’s run-time performance.Starting from GraalVM 20.1, this option is not needed anymore and thus deprecated.LLVM CompatibilityGraalVM works with LLVM bitcode versions 3.8 to 9.0. We recommend using theversion of LLVM that is shipped with GraalVM.Optimization FlagsIn contrast to the static compilation model of LLVM languages, in GraalVM themachine code is not directly produced from the LLVM bitcode, but there is anadditional dynamic compilation step by the GraalVM compiler.In this scenario, first the LLVM frontend (e.g., clang) does optimizations onthe bitcode level, and then the GraalVM compiler does its own optimizations on top of thatduring dynamic compilation. Some optimizations are better when doneahead-of-time on the bitcode, while other optimizations are better left for thedynamic compilation of the GraalVM compiler, when profiling information is available.The LLVM toolchain that is shipped with GraalVM automatically selects therecommended flags by default.In principle, all optimization levels should work, but for best results wesuggest compiling the bitcode with optimization level -O1.Cross-language interoperability will only work when the bitcode is compiledwith debug information enabled (-g), and the -mem2reg optimization isperformed on the bitcode (compiled with at least -O1, or explicitly using theopt tool).LLI Command Options--print-toolchain-path: print the path of the LLVM toolchain bundled withGraalVM.

Thebehavior of the lli interpreter tool used to directly execute programsin LLVM bitcode format differs between native and managed modes. Thedifference lies in safety guarantees and cross-language interoperability.In the default configuration, cross-language interoperability requires bitcodeto be compiled with the debug information enabled (-g), and the -mem2regoptimization is performed on the bitcode (compiled with at least -O1, orexplicitly using the opt tool). These requirements can be overcome in amanaged environment of GraalVM Enterprise that allows native code to participate in thepolyglot programs, passing and receiving the data from any other supportedlanguage. In terms of security, the execution of native code in a managedenvironment passes with additional safety features: catching illegal pointeraccesses, accessing arrays outside of the bounds, etc..There are certain limitations and differences to the native execution depending on the GraalVM edition.Consider them respectively.Limitations and Differences to Native Execution on Top of GraalVM CommunityThe LLVM interpreter in GraalVM Community Edition environment allows executing LLVM bitcode within amultilingual context. Even though it aspires to be a generic LLVM runtime, thereare certain fundamental and/or implementational limitations that users need tobe aware of.The following restrictions and differences to native execution (i.e., bitcode compiled down to native code) exist when LLVM bitcode is executed with the LLVM interpreter on top of GraalVM Community:  The GraalVM LLVM interpreter assumes that bitcode was generated to target the x86_64 architecture.  Bitcode should be the result of compiling C/C++ code using clang version 7, other compilers/languages, e.g., Rust, might have specific requirements that are not supported.  Unsupported functionality – it is not possible to call any of the following functions:          clone()      fork()      vfork()      setjmp(), sigsetjmp(), longjmp(), siglongjmp()      Functions of the exec() function family      Pthread functions      Code running in the LLVM interpreter needs to be aware that a JVM is running in the same process, so many syscalls such as fork, brk, sbrk, futex, mmap, rt_sigaction, rt_sigprocmask, etc. might not work as expected or cause the JVM to crash.      Calling unsupported syscalls or unsupported functionality (listed above) via native code libraries can cause unexpected side effects and crashes.        Thread local variables          Thread local variables from bitcode are not compatible with thread local variables from native code.        Cannot rely on memory layout          Pointers to thread local variables are not stored in specific locations, e.g., the FS segment.      The order of globals in memory might be different, consequently no assumptions about their relative locations can be made.      Stack frames cannot be inspected or modified using pointer arithmetic (overwrite return address, etc.).      Walking the stack is only possible using the Truffle APIs.      There is a strict separation between code and data, so that reads, writes and pointer arithmetic on function pointers or pointers to code will lead to undefined behavior.        Signal handlers          Installing signal handlers is not supported.        The stack          The default stack size is not set by the operating system but by the option --llvm.stackSize.        Dynamic linking          Interacting with the LLVM bitcode dynamic linker is not supported, e.g., dlsym/dlopen can only be used for native libraries.      The dynamic linking order is undefined if native libraries and LLVM bitcode libraries are mixed.      Native libraries cannot import symbols from bitcode libraries.        x86_64 inline assembly is not supported.  Undefined behavior according to C spec          While most C compilers map undefined behavior to CPU semantics, the GraalVM LLVM interpreter might map some of this undefined behavior to Java or other semantics. Examples include: signed integer overflow (mapped to the Java semantics of an arithmetic overflow), integer division by zero (will throw an ArithmeticException), oversized shift amounts (mapped to the Java behavior).        Floating point arithmetics          Some floating point operations and math functions will use more precise operations and cast the result to a lower precision (instead of performing the operation at a lower precision).      Only the rounding mode FE_TONEAREST is supported.      Floating point exceptions are not supported.        NFI limitations (calling real native functions)          Structs, complex numbers, or fp80 values are not supported as by-value arguments or by-value return values.      The same limitation applies to calls back from native code into interpreted LLVM bitcode.        Limitations of polyglot interoperability (working with values from other GraalVM languages)          Foreign objects cannot be stored in native memory locations. Native memory locations include:                  globals (except the specific case of a global holding exactly one pointer value);          malloc’ed memory (including c++ new, etc.);          stack (e.g., escaping automatic variables).                      LLVM instruction set support (based on LLVM 7.0.1)          A set of rarely-used bitcode instructions are not available (va_arg, catchpad, cleanuppad, catchswitch, catchret, cleanupret, fneg, callbr).      The instructions with limited support:                  atomicrmw (only supports sub, add, and, nand, or, xor, xchg);          extract value and insert value (only supports a single indexing operand);          cast (missing support for certain rarely-used kinds);          atomic ordering and address space attributes of load and store instructions are ignored.                    Values – assembly constants are not supported (module-level assembly and any assembly strings).      Types:                  There is no support for 128-bit floating point types (fp128 and ppc_fp128), x86_mmx, half-precision floats (fp16) and any vectors of unsupported primitive types.          The support for fp80 is limited (not all intrinsics are supported for fp80, some intrinsics or instructions might silently fall back to fp64).                      A number of rarely-used or experimental intrinsics based on LLVM 7.0.1 are not supported because of implementational limitations or because they are out of scope:          experimental intrinsics: llvm.experimental.*, llvm.launder.invariant.group, llvm.strip.invariant.group;      trampoline intrinsics: llvm.init.trampoline, llvm.adjust.trampoline;      general intrinsics: llvm.var.annotation, llvm.ptr.annotation, llvm.annotation, llvm.codeview.annotation, llvm.trap, llvm.debugtrap, llvm.stackprotector, llvm.stackguard, llvm.ssa_copy, llvm.type.test, llvm.type.checked.load, llvm.load.relative, llvm.sideeffect;      specialised arithmetic intrinsics: llvm.canonicalize, llvm.fmuladd;      standard c library intrinsics: llvm.fma, llvm.trunc, llvm.nearbyint, llvm.round;      code generator intrinsics: llvm.returnaddress, llvm.addressofreturnaddress, llvm.frameaddress, llvm.localescape, llvm.localrecover, llvm.read_register, llvm.write_register, llvm.stacksave, llvm.stackrestore, llvm.get.dynamic.area.offset, llvm.prefetch, llvm.pcmarker, llvm.readcyclecounter, llvm.clear_cache, llvm.instrprof*, llvm.thread.pointer;      exact gc intrinsics: llvm.gcroot, llvm.gcread, llvm.gcwrite;      element wise atomic memory intrinsics: llvm.*.element.unordered.atomic;      masked vector intrinsics: llvm.masked.*;      bit manipulation intrinsics: llvm.bitreverse, llvm.fshl, llvm.fshr.      Limitations and Differences to Managed Execution on Top of GraalVM EnterpriseA managed execution for LLVM intermediate representation code is GraalVMEnterprise Edition feature  and can be enabled with --llvm.managed commandline option. In the managed mode, GraalVM LLVM prevents access to unmanagedmemory and uncontrolled calls to native code and operating system functionality.The allocations are performed in the managed Java heap, and accesses to thesurrounding system are routed through proper Truffle API and Java API calls.All the restrictions from the default native LLVM execution on GraalVM apply to the managed execution, but with the following differences/changes:  Platform independent          Bitcode must be compiled for the a generic linux_x86_64 target, using the provided musl libc library, on all platforms, regardless of the actual underlying operating system.        C++          C++ on managed mode requires GraalVM 20.1 or newer        Native memory and code          Calls to native functions are not possible, thus only the functionality provided in the supplied musl libc and by the GraalVM LLVM interface is available.      Loading native libraries is not possible.      Native memory access is not possible.        System calls          System calls with only limited support are read, readv, write, writev, open, close, dup, dup2, lseek, stat, fstat, lstat, chmod, fchmod, ioctl, fcntl, unlink, rmdir, utimensat, uname, set_tid_address, gettid, getppid, getpid, getcwd, exit, exit_group, clock_gettime, arch_prctl.      The functionality is limited to common terminal IO, process control and file system operations.      Some syscalls are implemented as a noop and/or return errors warning that they are not available, e.g., chown, lchown, fchown, brk, rt_sigaction, sigprocmask, futex.        Musl libc          The musl libc library behaves differently than the more common glibc in some cases.        The stack          Accessing the stack pointer directly is not possible.      The stack is not contiguous, and accessing memory that is out of the bounds of a stack allocation (e.g., accessing neighboring stack value using pointer arithmetics) is not possible.        Pointers into the managed heap          Reading parts of a managed pointer is not possible.      Overwriting parts of a managed pointer (e.g., using bits for pointer tagging) and subsequently dereferencing the destroyed managed pointer is not possible.      Undefined behavior in C pointer arithmetics applies.      Complex pointer arithmetics (e.g., multiplying pointers) can convert a managed pointer to an i64 value – the i64 value can be used in pointer comparisons but cannot be dereferenced.        Floating point arithmetics          80-bit floating points only use 64-bit floating point precision.        Dynamic linking          The interaction with the LLVM bitcode dynamic linker is not supported, e.g., dlsym/dlopen cannot be used. This does not allow to load native code.      ",

Following commands should install those dependencies.  Ubuntu 18.04 and 19.10: apt-get install libgfortran-8-dev libgomp1  Oracle Linux 8: yum install libgfortran  MacOS: brew install gcc@4.9On macOS it is necessary to run $GRAALVM_HOME/bin/configure_fastr.This script will attempt to locate the necessary runtime libraries on your computerand will fine-tune the the GraalVM R installation according to your system.On Linux systems, this script will check that the necessary libraries are installed, and if not,it will suggest how to install them.Moreover, to install R packages that contain C/C++ or Fortran code, compilersfor those languages must be present on the target system. Following packagessatisfy the dependencies of the most common R packages:  Ubuntu 18.04:    apt-get install build-essential gfortran-8 libxml2 libc++-dev    Ubuntu 19.10:    apt-get install build-essential gfortran libxml2 libc++-dev    Oracle Linux 8:    yum groupinstall &#39;Development Tools&#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; yum install libgfortran gcc-gfortran bzip2 libxml2-devel  Search Paths for PackagesThe default R library location is within the GraalVM installation directory.In order to allow installation of additional packages for users thatdo not have write access to the GraalVM installation directory,edit the R_LIBS_USER variable in the $GRAALVM_HOME/etc/Renviron file.Running R CodeRun R code with the R and Rscript commands:$ R [polyglot options] [R options] [filename]$ Rscript [polyglot options] [R options] [filename]GraalVM R engine uses the same polyglot options as other GraalVM languages and the same R options as GNU R, e.g., bin/R --vanilla.Use --help to print the list of supported options. The most important options include:  --jvm to enable Java interoperability  --polyglot to enable interoperability with other GraalVM languages  --vm.Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true to pass any options to the JVM, this will be translated to -Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true.Note: unlike other GraalVM languages, R does not yet ship with aNative Image of its runtime.Therefore the --native option, which is the default, will still start Rscript on top of JVM,but for the sake of future compatibility the Java interoperability will not be available in such case.Users can optionally build the native image using:jre/languages/R/bin/install_r_native_imageRunning R ExtensionsThe GraalVM R engine can run R extensions in two modes:  native: the native machine code is run directly on your CPU, this is the same as how GNU-R runs R extensions.  llvm: if the LLVM bitcode is available, it can be interpreted by GraalVM LLVM.The native mode is better suited for code that does not extensively interact with the R API, for example,plain C or Fortran numerical computations working on primitive arrays. The llvm mode provides significantlybetter performance for extensions that frequently call between R and the C/C++ code, because GraalVM LLVMinterpreter is also partially evaluated by the Truffle library like the R code, both can be inlined and optimizedas one compilation unit. Moreover, GraalVM LLVM is supported byGraalVM tools which allows to, for instance,debug R and C code together.In one GraalVM R process, any R package can be loaded in either mode. That is, GraalVM R supportsmixing packages loaded in the native mode with packages loaded in the llvm mode in one process.Generating LLVM BitcodeAs of version 19.3.0, the GraalVM R engine is configured to use theLLVM toolchainto compile R packages native code. This toolchain produces standard executable binaries fora given system, but it also embeds the corresponding LLVM bitcode into them.The binaries produced by the LLVM toolchain can be loaded in both modes: native or llvm.The GraalVM R engine can be reconfigured to use your system default compilerswhen installing R packages by running:# use local installation of GGC:$ R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;native&quot;)&#39;# to revert back to using the GraalVM&#39;s LLVM toolchain:$ R -e &#39;fastr.setToolchain(&quot;llvm&quot;)&#39;Using the system default compilers may be more reliable, but you loose theability to load the R packages built with the LLVM toolchain in the llvm mode,because they will not contain the embedded bitcode. Moreover, mixing packagesbuilt by the local system default compilers and packages built by the LLVMtoolchain in one GraalVM R process may cause linking issues.Choosing the Running ModeStarting from the version 19.3.0, the GraalVM R engine uses the following defaults:  native mode to load the packages  llvm toolchain to build their sourcesTo enable the llvm mode for loading the packages, use --R.BackEnd=llvm.You can also enable each mode selectively for given R packages by using:  --R.BackEndLLVM=package1,package2  --R.BackEndNative=package1,package2GraalVM R Engine CompatibilityGraalVM implementation of R, known as FastR, is based on GNU R and reusesthe base packages. It is currently based on GNU-R 3.6.1, and moves to new majorversions of R as they become available and stable. The FastR project, maintains an extensive set of unittests for all aspects of the R language and the builtin functionality, and thesetests are available as part of the R source code. GraalVM R engine aims to befully compatible with GNU R, including its native interface as used by R extensions. Itcan install and run unmodified complex R packages like ggplot2, Shiny, orRcpp. As some packages rely on unspecified behavior or implementation detailsof GNU-R, support for packages is work in progress, and some packages might notinstall successfully or work as expected.Packages can be installed using the install.packages function or the R CMD INSTALL shell command.By default, R uses fixed snapshot of the CRAN repository1.This behavior can be overridden by explicitly setting the repos argument of the install.packages function.This functionality does not interfere with the checkpoint package. If you are behind a proxy server, makesure to configure the proxy either with environment variables or using the JVM options,e.g., --vm.Djava.net.useSystemProxies=true.Versions of some packages specifically patched for GraalVM implementation of R can be installed using the install.fastr.packagesfunction that downloads them from the GitHub repository.Currently, those are rJava and data.table.Known limitations of GraalVM implementation of R compared to GNU R:  Only small parts of the low-level graphics package are functional. However, the grid package is supported and R can install and run packages based on it like ggplot2.   Support for the graphics package in R is planned for future releases.  Encoding of character vectors. Related builtins (e.g., Encoding) are available,   but do not execute any useful code. Character vectors are represented as Java Strings and therefore encoded in UTF-16 format. GraalVM implementation of R will add support for encoding in future releases.  Some parts of the native API (e.g., DATAPTR) expose implementation details that are hard to emulate for alternative implementations of R. These are implemented as needed while testing the GraalVM implementation of R with various CRAN packages.You can use the compatibility checker to find whether the CRAN packages you are interested in are tested on GraalVM and whether the tests pass successfully.High PerformanceGraalVM runtime optimizes R code that runs for extended periods of time.The speculative optimizations based on the runtime behavior of the R code and dynamic compilation employed by GraalVM runtime are capable of removing most of the abstraction penalty incurred by the dynamism and complexity of the R language.Let us look at an algorithm in R code. The following example calculates themutual information of a large matrix:x &amp;lt;- matrix(runif(1000000), 1000, 1000)mutual_R &amp;lt;- function(joint_dist) { joint_dist &amp;lt;- joint_dist/sum(joint_dist) mutual_information &amp;lt;- 0 num_rows &amp;lt;- nrow(joint_dist) num_cols &amp;lt;- ncol(joint_dist) colsums &amp;lt;- colSums(joint_dist) rowsums &amp;lt;- rowSums(joint_dist) for(i in seq_along(1:num_rows)){  for(j in seq_along(1:num_cols)){   temp &amp;lt;- log((joint_dist[i,j]/(colsums[j]*rowsums[i])))   if(!is.finite(temp)){    temp = 0   }   mutual_information &amp;lt;-    mutual_information + joint_dist[i,j] * temp  } } mutual_information}system.time(mutual_R(x))#   user  system elapsed#  1.321   0.010   1.279Algorithms such as this one usually require C/C++ code to run efficiently:2if (!require(&#39;RcppArmadillo&#39;)) {    install.packages(&#39;RcppArmadillo&#39;)    library(RcppArmadillo)}library(Rcpp)sourceCpp(&quot;r_mutual.cpp&quot;)x &amp;lt;- matrix(runif(1000000), 1000, 1000)system.time(mutual_cpp(x))#   user  system elapsed#  0.037   0.003   0.040(Uses r_mutual.cpp.)However, after a few iterations, GraalVM runs the R code efficiently enough tomake the performance advantage of C/C++ negligible:system.time(mutual_R(x))#   user  system elapsed#  0.063   0.001   0.077GraalVM implementation of R is primarily aimed at long-running applications. Therefore, the peak performance is usually only achieved after a warmup period. While startup time is currently slower than GNUR’s, due to the overhead from Java class loading and compilation, future releases will contain a native image of R with improved startup.GraalVM IntegrationThe R language integration with the GraalVM ecosystem includes:  seamless interop with other GraalVM languages and with Java  debugging with Chrome DevTools  CPU and memory profiling  VisualVM integrationTo start debugging the code start the R script with --inspect option$ Rscript --inspect myScript.RNote that GNU R compatible debugging using, for example, debug(myFunction) is also supported.InteroperabilityGraalVM supports several other programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and LLVM.GraalVM implementation of R also provides an API for programming language interoperability that lets you execute code from any other language that GraalVM supports. Note that you must start the R script with --polyglot to have access to other GraalVM languages.GraalVM execution of R provides the following interoperability primitives:  eval.polyglot(&#39;languageId&#39;, &#39;code&#39;) evaluates code in some other language, the languageId can be, e.g., js.  eval.polyglot(path = &#39;/path/to/file.extension&#39;) evaluates code loaded from a file. The language is recognized from the extension.  export(&#39;polyglot-value-name&#39;, rObject) exports an R object so that it can be imported by other languages.  import(&#39;exported-polyglot-value-name&#39;) imports a polyglot value exported by some other language.Please use the ?functionName syntax to learn more. The following example demonstrates the interoperability features:# get an array from Rubyx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;)print(x[[1]])# [1] 1# get a JavaScript objectx &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(path=&#39;r_example.js&#39;)print(x$a)# [1] &quot;value&quot;# use R vector in JavaScriptexport(&#39;robj&#39;, c(1,2,3))eval.polyglot(&#39;js&#39;, paste0(    &#39;rvalue = Polyglot.import(&quot;robj&quot;); &#39;,    &#39;console.log(&quot;JavaScript: &quot; + rvalue.length);&#39;))# JavaScript: 3# NULL -- the return value of eval.polyglot(Uses r_example.js.)R vectors are presented as arrays to other languages. This includes single element vectors, e.g., 42L or NA.However, single element vectors that do not contain NA can be typically used in places where the otherlanguages expect a scalar value. Array subscript or similar operation can be used in other languages to accessindividual elements of an R vector. If the element of the vector is not NA, the actual valueis returned as a scalar value. If the element is NA, then a special object that looks like nullis returned. The following Ruby code demonstrates this.vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c(NA, 42)&quot;)p vec[0].nil?# truep vec[1]# 42vec = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;42&quot;)p vec.to_s# &quot;[42]&quot;p vec[0]# 42The foreign objects passed to R are implicitly treated as specific R types.The following table gives some examples.            Example of foreign object (Java)      Viewed ‘as if’ on the R side                  int[] {1,2,3}      c(1L,2L,3L)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} }      matrix(c(1:3,1:3),nrow=3)              int[][] { {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3} }      not supported: raises error              Object[] {1, ‘a’, ‘1’}      list(1L, ‘a’, ‘1’)              42      42L      In the following code example, we can simply just pass the Ruby array to the R built-in function sum,which will work with the Ruby array as if it was integer vector.sum(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))Foreign objects can be also explicitly wrapped into adapters that make them look like the desired R type.In such a case, no data copying occurs if possible. The code snippet below shows the most common use cases.# gives list instead of an integer vectoras.list(eval.polyglot(&#39;ruby&#39;, &#39;[1,2,3]&#39;))# assume the following Java code:# public class ClassWithArrays {#   public boolean[] b = {true, false, true};#   public int[] i = {1, 2, 3};# }x &amp;lt;- new(&#39;ClassWithArrays&#39;); # see Java interop belowas.list(x)# gives: list(c(T,F,T), c(1L,2L,3L))For more details, please refer tothe executable specificationof the implicit and explicit foreign objects conversions.Note that R contexts started from other languages or Java (as opposed to via the bin/R script) will default to non-interactive mode, similar to bin/Rscript.This has implications on console output (results are not echoed) and graphics (output defaults to a file instead of a window), and some packages may behave differently in non-interactive mode.See the Polyglot Reference and theEmbedding documentationfor more information about interoperability with other programming languages.Interoperability with JavaGraalVM R engine provides built-in interoperability with Java. Java class objects can be obtained via java.type(...).The standard new function interprets string arguments as a Java class if such class exists. new also accepts Java types returned from java.type.Fields and methods of Java objects can be accessed using the $ operator.Additionally, you can use awt(...) to open an R drawing devicedirectly on a Java Graphics surface, for more details see Java Based Graphics.The following example creates a new Java BufferedImage object, plots random data to it using R’s grid package,and shows the image in a window using Java’s AWT framework. Note that you must start the R script with --jvm to have access to Java interoperability.library(grid)openJavaWindow &amp;lt;- function () {   # create image and register graphics   imageClass &amp;lt;- java.type(&#39;java.awt.image.BufferedImage&#39;)   image &amp;lt;- new(imageClass, 450, 450, imageClass$TYPE_INT_RGB);   graphics &amp;lt;- image$getGraphics()   graphics$setBackground(java.type(&#39;java.awt.Color&#39;)$white);   grDevices:::awt(image$getWidth(), image$getHeight(), graphics)   # draw image   grid.newpage()   pushViewport(plotViewport(margins = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1)))   grid.xaxis(); grid.yaxis()   grid.points(x = runif(10, 0, 1), y = runif(10, 0, 1),        size = unit(0.01, &quot;npc&quot;))   # open frame with image   imageIcon &amp;lt;- new(&quot;javax.swing.ImageIcon&quot;, image)   label &amp;lt;- new(&quot;javax.swing.JLabel&quot;, imageIcon)   panel &amp;lt;- new(&quot;javax.swing.JPanel&quot;)   panel$add(label)   frame &amp;lt;- new(&quot;javax.swing.JFrame&quot;)   frame$setMinimumSize(new(&quot;java.awt.Dimension&quot;,                image$getWidth(), image$getHeight()))   frame$add(panel)   frame$setVisible(T)   while (frame$isVisible()) Sys.sleep(1)}openJavaWindow()For more information on FastR interoperability with Java and other languages implemented with Truffle framework,refer to the Interoperability tutorial.GraalVM implementation of R provides its own rJava compatible replacement package available at GitHub,which can be installed using:$ R -e &quot;install.fastr.packages(&#39;rJava&#39;)&quot;GraalVM R Engine Additional FeaturesJava Based GraphicsThe GraalVM implementation of R includes its own Java based implementation of the grid package and the following graphics devices: png, jpeg, bmp, svg and awt (X11 is aliased to awt). The graphics package and most of its functions are not supported at the moment.The awt device is based on the Java Graphics2D object and users can pass it their own Graphics2D object instance when opening the device using the awt function, as shown in the Java interop example.When the Graphics2D object is not provided to awt, it opens a new window similarly to X11.The svg device in GraalVM implementation of R generates more lightweight SVG code than the svg implementation in GNU R.Moreover, functions tailored to manipulate the SVG device are provided: svg.off and svg.string.The SVG device is demonstrated in the following code sample. Please use the ?functionName syntax to learn more.library(lattice)svg()mtcars$cars &amp;lt;- rownames(mtcars)print(barchart(cars~mpg, data=mtcars))svgCode &amp;lt;- svg.off()cat(svgCode)In-Process Parallel ExecutionGraalVM R engine adds a new cluster type SHARED for the parallel package. This cluster starts new jobs as new threads inside the same process. Example:library(parallel)cl0 &amp;lt;- makeCluster(7, &#39;SHARED&#39;)clusterApply(cl0, seq_along(cl0), function(i) i)Worker nodes inherit the attached packages from the parent node with copy-on-write semantics, but not the global environment.This means that you do not need to load again R libraries on the worker nodes but values (including functions) from the globalenvironment have to be transfered to the worker nodes, e.g., using clusterExport.Note that unlike with the FORK or PSOCK clusters the child nodes in SHARED cluster are running in the same process,therefore, e.g., locking files with lockfile or flock will not work. Moreover, the SHARED cluster is based onan assumption that packages’ native code does not mutate shared vectors (which is a discouraged practice) and is threadsafe and re-entrant on the C level.If the code that you want to parallelize does not match these expectations, you can still use the PSOCK cluster with the GraalVM R engine.The FORK cluster and functions depending solely on forking (e.g., mcparallel) are not supported at the moment.1 More technically, GraalVM implementation of R uses a fixed MRAN URL from $R_HOME/etc/DEFAULT_CRAN_MIRROR, which is a snapshot of theCRAN repository as it was visible at a given date from the URL string.2 When this example is run for the first time, it installs the RcppArmadillo package,which may take few minutes. Note that this example can be run in both R executedwith GraalVM and GNU R.",

More than 100,000 npm packages are regularly tested and are compatible with GraalVM, including modules like express, react, async, request, browserify, grunt, mocha, and underscore.The latest release of GraalVM is based on Node.js version 12.15.0.Nashorn Compatibility ModeGraalVM announced support for Nashorn migrationdue to the announced deprecation of Nashorn in the JDK. GraalVM JavaScriptprovides a Nashorn compatibility mode for some of the functionality not exposedby default, but necessary to run an application that was built for Nashornspecifically. Check the list of extensionsto JavaScript (ECMAScript) that are available in GraalVM JavaScript. Some ofthem provide features that are available in Nashorn as well. For ECMAScriptcompatibility, most of those features are deactivated by default in GraalVM butcan be activated with flags. Note that using the Nashorn compatibility modeallows your application to bypass the GraalVM security model.If the source code includes some Nashorn-specific extensions, the Nashorncompatibility mode should be enabled. It can be activated:  with the js.nashorn-compat option from the command line:    js --experimental-options --js.nashorn-compat=true    by using the Polyglot API:    import org.graalvm.polyglot.Context;try (Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowExperimentalOptions(true).option(&quot;js.nashorn-compat&quot;, &quot;true&quot;).build()) {  context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;print(__LINE__)&quot;);}    by using a system property when starting a Java application:    java -Dpolyglot.js.nashorn-compat=true MyApplication  We strongly encourage you to use the Nashorn compatibility mode only as a meansof getting your application running on GraalVM JavaScript initially. Enablingthe Nashorn compatibility mode gives your application full access to the Javamode. This bypasses the GraalVM security model of limiting JavaScript user codeto “less trusted code” that is consistent with all other GraalVM languages. Itis highly recommended not to use the Nashorn compatibility mode in productioncode if you execute less trusted user code. Some features of the Nashorncompatibility mode might in the future conflict with new ECMAScript and/orGraalVM JavaScript features.We provide migration guides for code previously targeted to the Nashorn or Rhino engines.See the JavaInterop.md for an overview of supported Java interoperability features.For additional information, see the Polyglot Reference and theEmbedding documentationfor more information about interoperability with other programming languages.Is GraalVM compatible with the JavaScript language?What version of ECMAScript do we support?GraalVM is compatible to the ECMAScript 2019 specification.Some features of ECMAScript 2020 including some proposed features and extensions are available as well, but might not be fully implemented, compliant, or stable, yet.How do we know it?The compatibility of GraalVM JavaScript is verified by external sources, like the Kangax ECMAScript compatibility table.On our CI system, we test GraalVM JavaScript against a set of test engines, like the official test suite of ECMAScript, test262, as well as tests published by V8 and Nashorn, Node.js unit tests, and GraalVM’s own unit tests.For a reference of the JavaScript APIs that GraalVM supports, see GRAAL.JS-API.Is GraalVM compatible with the original node implementation?Node.js based on GraalVM is largely compatible with the original Node.js (based on the V8 engine).This leads to a high number of npm-based modules being compatible with GraalVM (out of the 95k modules we test, more than 90% of them pass all tests).Several sources of differences have to be considered.      Setup:GraalVM mostly mimicks the original setup of Node, including the node executable, npm, and similar. However, not all command-line options are supported (or behave exactly identically), you need to (re-)compile native modules against our v8.h file, etc.        Internals:GraalVM is implemented on top of a JVM, and thus has a different internal architecture. This implies that some internal mechanisms behave differently and cannot exactly replicate V8 behavior. This will hardly ever affect user code, but might affect modules implemented natively, depending on V8 internals.        Performance:Due to GraalVM being implemented on top of a JVM, performance characteristics vary from the original native implementation. While GraalVM’s peak performance can match V8 on many benchmarks, it will typically take longer to reach the peak (known as warmup). Be sure to give the GraalVM compiler some extra time when measuring (peak) performance.  How do we determine GraalVM’s JavaScript compatibility?GraalVM is compatible to ECMAScript 2019, guaranteeing compatibility on the language level.In addition, GraalVM uses the following approaches to check and retain compatibility to Node.js code:  node-compat-table: GraalVM is compared against other engines using the node-compat-table module, highlighting incompatibilities that might break Node.js code.  automated mass-testing of modules using mocha: in order to test a large set of modules, GraalVM is tested against 95k modules that use the mocha test framework. Using mocha allows automating the process of executing the test and comprehending the test result.  manual testing of popular modules: a select list of npm modules is tested in a manual test setup. These highly-relevant modules are tested in a more sophisticated manner.If you want your module to be tested by GraalVM in the future, ensure the module provides some mocha tests (and send us an email so we can ensure it is on the list of tested modules).How can one verify GraalVM works on their application?If your module ships with tests, execute them with GraalVM.Of course, this will only test your app, but not its dependencies.You can use the compatibility checker to find whether the module you’re interested in is tested on GraalVM, whether the tests pass successfully and so on.Additionally, you can upload your package-lock.json or package.json file into that utility and it’ll analyze all your dependencies at once.GraalVM JavaScript OptionsOn the command line, --js.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; sets options that tune language features and extensions.The following options are currently supported:  --js.annex-b: enables ECMAScript Annex B web compatibility features. Boolean value, default is true.  --js.array-sort-inherited: defines whether Array.protoype.sort should sort inherited keys (implementation-defined behavior). Boolean value, default is true.  --js.atomics: enables ES2017 Atomics. Boolean value, default is true.  --js.ecmascript-version: emulates a specific ECMAScript version. Integer value (5-9), default is the latest version.  --js.intl-402: enables ECMAScript Internationalization API. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.regexp-static-result: provides static RegExp properties containing results of the last successful match, e.g.: RegExp.$1 (legacy). Boolean value, default is true.  --js.shared-array-buffer: enables ES2017 SharedArrayBuffer. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.strict: enables strict mode for all scripts. Boolean value, default is false.  --js.timezone: sets the local time zone. String value, default is the system default.  --js.v8-compat: provides better compatibility with Google’s V8 engine. Boolean value, default is false.Use --help:languages to see the full list of available options.See the Polyglot Reference for information on how to set options programmatically when embedding.GraalVM Options--jvm executes the application on the JVM instead of in the Native Image.--vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; passes VM options and system properties to the Native Image.To pass JVM options to GraalVM you need to provide --jvm before,i.e., --jvm --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;. List all available system properties to the Native Image,JVM and VM options and with --help:vm.System properties can be set as follows: --vm.D&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.For example, --vm.Dgraal.TraceTruffleCompilation=true will print finished compilations.--compiler.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; passes settings to the compiler.For example, --compiler.CompilationThreshold=&amp;lt;Integer&amp;gt; sets the minimum number of invocations or loop iterations before a function is compiled.Polyglot Options--polyglot enables you to interoperate with other programming languages.--&amp;lt;languageID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; passes options to guest languages through the GraalVM Polyglot SDK.Use --help:languages to find out which options are available.GraalVM JavaScript Operations ManualWhat’s the difference between running GraalVM’s JavaScript in a Native Image compared to the JVM?In essence, the JavaScript engine of GraalVM is a plain Java application.Running it on any JVM (JDK 8 or higher) is possible; for best performance, it should be the GraalVM or a compatible JVMCI-enabled JDK using the GraalVM compiler.This mode gives the JavaScript engine full access to Java at runtime, but also requires the JVM to first (just-in-time) compile the JavaScript engine when executed, just like any other Java application.Running in a Native Image means that the JavaScript engine, including all its dependencies from, e.g., the JDK, is pre-compiled into a native binary.This will tremendously speed up the startup of any JavaScript application, as GraalVM can immediately start to compile JavaScript code, without itself requiring to be compiled first.This mode, however, will only give GraalVM access to Java classes known at the time of image creation.Most significantly, this means that the JavaScript-to-Java interoperability features are not available in this mode, as they would require dynamic class loading and execution of arbitrary Java code at runtime.How to achieve the best peak performance?Optimizing JVM-based applications is a science in itself.Here are a few tips and tricks you can follow to analyse and improve peak performance:  When measuring, ensure you have given the GraalVM compiler enough time to compile all hot methods before starting to measure peak performance. A useful command line option for that is --vm.Dgraal.TraceTruffleCompilation=true – this outputs a message whenever a (JavaScript) method is compiled. As long as this still prints frequently, measurement should not yet start.  Compare the performance between the Native Image and the JVM mode if possible. Depending on the characteristics of your application, one or the other might show better peak performance.  The Polyglot API comes with several tools and options to inspect the performance of your application:          --cpusampler and --cputracer will print a list of the hottest methods when the application is terminated. Use that list to figure out where most time is spent in your application. More details about the command line options for the polyglot commands can be found from the  polyglot documentation.      --experimental-options --memtracer can help you understand the memory allocations of your application. Refer to Profiling command line tools reference for more detail.      ",

It uses a dynamiccompiler that dramatically improves the efficiency and the speed of applicationsthrough unique approaches to code analysis and optimization.InteroperabilityIn addition to running JVM-based languages, you can also call any other languageimplemented with Truffle Language Implementation framework directly from Java.See the Polyglot Reference and theEmbedding documentationfor more information about interoperability with other programming languages.Compiler PerformanceThe GraalVM compiler achieves excellent performance for modern workloadssuch as Scala or usage of the Java Streams API. For examples, see theJava performance examples.Compiler Operating ModesThere are two operating modes of the GraalVM compiler when used as a HotSpot JIT compiler:      libgraal: the GraalVM compiler is compiled ahead of time into a native shared library. In this operating mode, the shared library is loaded by the HotSpot VM. The compiler uses memory separate from the HotSpot heap and it runs fast from the start since it does not need to warm-up. This is the default and recommended mode of operation.        jargraal: the GraalVM compiler goes through the same warm-up phase that the rest of Java application does. That is, it is first interpreted before its hot methods are compiled. This mode is selected with the -XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary command line option. This will delay the time to reach peak performance as the compileritself needs to be compiled before it produces code quickly. This mode allows you todebug the GraalVM compiler with a Java debugger.  Compiler Configuration on JVMThe options for configuring the GraalVM compiler on the JVM are in 3 categories.General optionsThese are general options for setting/getting configuration details.  -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler: This disables use of the GraalVM compiler as the top tier JIT.This is useful when wanting to compare performance of the GraalVM compiler against the native JIT compilers.      -Dgraal.CompilerConfiguration=&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;: Selects the GraalVM compiler configuration to use. If omitted, the compilerconfiguration with the highest auto-selection priority is used. To see the setof available configurations, supply the value help to this option.    The current configurations and their semantics are:          enterprise: To produce highly optimized code with a possible trade-off to compilation time.GraalVM Enterprise feature.      community: To produce reasonably optimized code with a faster compilation time.      economy: To compile as fast as possible with less optimal throughput of the generated code.            -Dgraal.ShowConfiguration=none: Prints information about the GraalVM compiler configuration selected.  This option only produces output when the compiler is initialized. By default, the GraalVM compiler is  initialized on the first top-tier compilation. For this reason, the way to use this option  is as follows: java -XX:+EagerJVMCI -Dgraal.ShowConfiguration=info -version.    The accepted values for this option are:          none: To show no information.      info: To print one line of output showing the name of the compiler configuration in use and the location it is loaded from.      verbose: To print detailed compiler configuration information.            -Dgraal.MitigateSpeculativeExecutionAttacks=None: Selects a strategy to mitigate speculative  execution attacks (e.g., SPECTRE).    Accepted values are:          None: No mitigations are used in JIT compiled code.      AllTargets: All branches are protected against speculative attacks. This has a largeperformance impact.      GuardTargets: Only branches that preserve Java memory safety are protected. This hasreduced performance impact.      NonDeoptGuardTargets: Same as GuardTargets except that branches which deoptimize arenot protected since they can not be executed repeatedly.      Performance tuning options  -Dgraal.UsePriorityInlining=true: This can be used to disable use of the advanced inliningalgorithm that favors throughput over compilation speed. GraalVM Enterprise feature  -Dgraal.Vectorization=true: This can be used to disable the auto vectorization optimization.GraalVM Enterprise feature  -Dgraal.OptDuplication=true: This can be used to disable the path duplication optimization. GraalVM Enterprise feature      -Dgraal.TraceInlining=false: Enables tracing of inlining decisions. This can be used  for advanced tuning where it may be possible to change the source code of the program.  The output format is shown below:    compilation of &#39;Signature of the compilation root method&#39;:at &#39;Sig of the root method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]: &amp;lt;&#39;Phase&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Child method signature&#39;: &#39;Decision made about this callsite&#39;  at &#39;Signature of the child method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]:     |--&amp;lt;&#39;Phase 1&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;First decision made about this callsite&#39;     --&amp;lt;&#39;Phase 2&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;Second decision made about this callsite&#39;  at &#39;Signature of the child method&#39; [&#39;Bytecode index&#39;]: &amp;lt;&#39;Phase&#39;&amp;gt; &#39;Another grandchild method signature&#39;: &#39;The only decision made about this callsite.&#39;    For example:    compilation of java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(int):at java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(Character.java:7138) [bci: 22]:   ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterData.of(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke   └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterData.of(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.at java.lang.Character.toUpperCaseEx(Character.java:7138) [bci: 26]:   ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke   └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.  at java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.toUpperCaseEx(CharacterDataLatin1.java:223) [bci: 4]:     ├──&amp;lt;GraphBuilderPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.getProperties(int): no, bytecode parser did not replace invoke     └──&amp;lt;PriorityInliningPhase&amp;gt; java.lang.CharacterDataLatin1.getProperties(int): yes, worth inlining according to the cost-benefit analysis.  Diagnostic options      -Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction=Silent: Specifies the action to take when compilation fails by  throwing an exception.    The accepted values are:          Silent: Print nothing to the console.      Print: Print a stack trace to the console.      Diagnose: Retry the compilation with extra diagnostics enabled. On VM exit, the collected diagnostics are saved to a zip file that can be submitted along with a bug report. A message is printed to the console describing where the diagnostics file is saved:        Graal diagnostic output saved in /Users/graal/graal_dumps/1549459528316/graal_diagnostics_22774.zip            ExitVM: Same as Diagnose except that the VM process exits after retrying.        For all values except for ExitVM, the VM continues executing.    -Dgraal.CompilationBailoutAsFailure=false: The compiler may not complete compilation of a method due to some property or code shape in the method (e.g., exotic uses of the jsr and ret bytecodes). In this case the compilation bails out. If you want to be informed of such bailouts, this option makes GraalVM treat bailouts as failures and thus be subject to the action specified by the -Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction option.  -Dgraal.PrintCompilation=false: Prints an informational line to the console for each completed compilation.For example:    HotSpotCompilation-11  Ljava/lang/Object;                            wait          ()V       |  591ms    12B    92B  4371kBHotSpotCompilation-175 Ljava/lang/String;                            lastIndexOf   (II)I     |  590ms   126B   309B  4076kBHotSpotCompilation-184 Ljava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap;      setTabAt      ([Ljava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap$Node;ILjava/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap$Node;)V  |  591ms    38B    67B  3411kBHotSpotCompilation-136 Lsun/nio/cs/UTF_8$Encoder;                    encode        ([CII[B)I |  591ms   740B   418B  4921  Setting Compiler Options with Language LaunchersThe GraalVM compiler properties above are usable with some other GraalVM launchers such asnode, js and lli. The prefix for specifying the properties is slightly different.For example:$ java -XX:+EagerJVMCI -Dgraal.ShowConfiguration=info -versionBecomes:$ js --jvm --vm.Dgraal.ShowConfiguration=info -versionNote the -D prefix is replaced by --vm.D.JVM Operations ManualDifference between running the GraalVM compiler in a Native Image vs on the JVMWhen running the GraalVM compiler on the JVM, it goes through the same warmup phase that therest of Java application does. That is, it is first interpreted beforeits hot methods are compiled. This can translate into slightly longer timesuntil the application reaches peak performance when compared to the native compilersin the JVM such as C1 and C2.To address the issue of taking longer to reach to peak performance, libgraalwas introduced – a shared library, produced using Native Image to ahead-of-time compile the compiler itself. That means the GraalVMcompiler is deployed as a native shared library. In this mode, thecompiler uses memory separate from the HotSpot heap and it runs compiled fromthe start. That is, it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpotcompilers such as C1 and C2. Currently, this is the default mode ofoperation in both GraalVM Community and Enterprise images. It can be disabledwith -XX:-UseJVMCINativeLibrary.Measuring PerformanceThe first thing to be sure of when measuring the performance is to ensure the JVM is using the GraalVM compiler.In the GraalVM binary, the JVM is configured to use the GraalVM compileras the top tier compiler by default. You can confirm this by adding -Dgraal.ShowConfiguration=infoto the command line. It will produce a line of output similar to the one belowwhen the compiler is initialized:Using Graal compiler configuration &#39;community&#39; provided by org.graalvm.compiler.hotspot.CommunityCompilerConfigurationFactory loaded from jar:file:/Users/dsimon/graal/graal/compiler/mxbuild/dists/graal.jar!/org/graalvm/compiler/hotspot/CommunityCompilerConfigurationFactory.classNote that the GraalVM compiler is only initialized on the first top tier JIT compilation requestso if your application is short lived, you may not see this output.Optimizing JVM-based applications is a science in itself. The compilation may noteven be a factor in the case of poor performance as the problem maylie in any other part of the VM (I/O, garbage collection, threading etc) or inpoorly written application or 3rd party library code. For this reason, it’sworth using profilers such as Java Mission Control todiagnose application behavior.You can also compare performance against the native top tier compiler in the JVM byadding -XX:-UseJVMCICompiler to the command line.If you observe a significant performance regression when using the GraalVM compiler, pleaseopen an issue on GitHub. Attaching a Java Flight Recorder log and instructionsto reproduce the issue makes investigation easier and thuschances of a fix higher. Even better is if you can submit a JMHbenchmark that represents the hottest parts of your application (as identifiedby a profiler). This allows us to very quickly pinpoint missing optimizationopportunities or to offer suggestions on how to restructure the code toavoid or reduce performance bottlenecks.Troubleshooting the GraalVM CompilerLike all software, the GraalVM compiler is not guaranteed to be bug free so it is useful toknow how to diagnose and submit useful bug reports if you encounter issues.If you spot a security vulnerability, please do not report it via GitHub Issues or the public mailing lists,but via the process outlined at Reporting Vulnerabilities guide.Compilation ExceptionsOne advantage of the compiler being written in Java is that runtime exceptions duringcompilation are not fatal VM errors. Instead, each compilation has an exceptionhandler that takes an action based on the graal.CompilationFailureActionproperty.The default value is Silent. Specifying Diagnose causes failing compilations to be retriedwith extra diagnostics enabled. Just before the VM exits, all diagnostic outputcaptured during retried compilations is written to a .zip file and its locationis printed on the console:Graal diagnostic output saved in /Users/demo/graal-dumps/1499768882600/graal_diagnostics_64565.zipYou can then attach the .zip file to an issue on GitHub.Apart from Silent and Diagnose the following values for graal.CompilationFailureActionare supported:  Print: Prints a message and stack trace to the console but does not do the re-compilation.  ExitVM: Same as Diagnose but the VM process exits after the re-compilation.Code Generation ErrorsThe other type of error compilers can have is producing incorrect machine code.This error can cause a VM crash, which should produce a file that starts withhs_err_pid in the current working directory of the VM process. In most cases,there is a section in the file that shows the stack at the time of the crash,including the type of code for each frame in the stack, as in the followingexample:Stack: [0x00007000020b1000,0x00007000021b1000],  sp=0x00007000021af7a0,  free space=1017kNative frames: (J=compiled Java code, j=interpreted, Vv=VM code, C=native code)J 761 JVMCI org.graalvm.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)V (299 bytes) @ 0x0000000108a2fc01 [0x0000000108a2fac0+0x141] (null)j  org.graalvm.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.doBlock(Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/cfg/Block;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/StructuredGraph;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/core/common/cfg/BlockMap;)V+211j  org.graalvm.compiler.core.LIRGenerationPhase.emitBlock(Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/spi/NodeLIRBuilderTool;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/lir/gen/LIRGenerationResult;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/cfg/Block;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/StructuredGraph;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/core/common/cfg/BlockMap;)V+65This example shows that the top frame was compiled (J) by the JVMCI compiler,which is the GraalVM compiler. The crash occurred at offset 0x141 in the machinecode produced for:org.graalvm.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)VThe next two frames in the stack were executing in the interpreter (j). Thelocation of the crash is also often indicated near the top of the file withsomething like this:# Problematic frame:# J 761 JVMCI org.graalvm.compiler.core.gen.NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions(Ljava/util/List;)V (299 bytes) @ 0x0000000108a2fc01 [0x0000000108a2fac0+0x141] (null)In this example, there is likely an error in the code produced by the GraalVM compiler for NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions.When filing an issue on GitHubfor such a crash, you should first attempt to reproduce the crash with extradiagnostics enabled for the compilation of the problematic method.In this example, you would add the following to your command line:-Dgraal.MethodFilter=NodeLIRBuilder.matchComplexExpressions, -Dgraal.Dump=:2These options are described in more detail here.In brief, these options tell the compiler to capture snapshots of the compiler state atverbosity level 2 while compiling any method named matchComplexExpressions ina class with a simple name of NodeLIRBuilder. The complete format of theMethodFilter option is described in the output of java -XX:+JVMCIPrintProperties.Quite often, the crash location does not exist directly in the problematic methodmentioned in the crash log but comes from an inlined method.In such a case, simply filtering for the problematic method might not capture anerroneous compilation causing a crash.To improve the likelihood of capturing an erroneous compilation, you need tobroaden the MethodFilter value. To guide this, add -Dgraal.PrintCompilation=truewhen trying to reproduce the crash so you can see what was compiled just beforethe crash.The following shows sample output from the console:HotSpotCompilation-1218        Lorg/graalvm/compiler/core/amd64/AMD64NodeLIRBuilder;                  peephole                                      (Lorg/graalvm/compiler/nodes/ValueNode;)Z           |   87ms   428B   447B  1834kBHotSpotCompilation-1212        Lorg/graalvm/compiler/lir/LIRInstructionClass;                         forEachState                                  (Lorg/graalvm/compiler/lir/LIRInstruction;Lorg/graalvm/compiler/lir/InstructionValueProcedure;)V  |  359ms    92B   309B  6609kBHotSpotCompilation-1221        Lorg/graalvm/compiler/hotspot/amd64/AMD64HotSpotLIRGenerator;          getResult                                     ()Lorg/graalvm/compiler/hotspot/HotSpotLIRGenerationResult;  |   54ms    18B   142B  1025kB## A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:##  SIGSEGV (0xb) at pc=0x000000010a6cafb1, pid=89745, tid=0x0000000000004b03## JRE version: OpenJDK Runtime Environment (8.0_121-b13) (build 1.8.0_121-graalvm-olabs-b13)# Java VM: OpenJDK 64-Bit GraalVM (25.71-b01-internal-jvmci-0.30 mixed mode bsd-amd64 compressed oops)# Problematic frame:# J 1221 JVMCI org.graalvm.compiler.hotspot.amd64.AMD64HotSpotLIRGenerator.getResult()Lorg/graalvm/compiler/hotspot/HotSpotLIRGenerationResult; (18 bytes) @ 0x000000010a6cafb1 [0x000000010a6caf60+0x51] (null)## Failed to write core dump.

At this point, the Pythonimplementation is made available for experimentation and curious end-users.Note, Python is currently experimental.Installing PythonPython can be installed to a GraalVM build with the functional gu utility:gu install pythonThe above command will install a community version of a component from GitHub catalog.For GraalVM Enterprise users, the manual component installation is required. See bin/gu --help for more information.Running PythonGraalVM implementation of Python targets Python 3.7 compatibility at the moment. While support forthe Python language is still limited, you can run simple Python scripts or commandswith the graalpython binary:$ graalpython [options] [-c cmd | filename]If no program file or command is given, you are dropped into a simple REPL.GraalVM supports some of the same options as Python 3.7 and some additionaloptions to control the underlying Python implementation, the GraalVM toolsand the execution engine. These can be viewed using the following command:$ graalpython --help --help:tools --help:languagesInstalling Supported PackagesPython comes with a tool called ginstall used to install a small list ofpackages known to work to some extent with GraalVM implementation of Python.It is recommended to always create a virtual environment first, using thestandard Python module venv. Creating such an environment avoids anyincompatible interaction with the local user’s packages that may have beeninstalled using a system installation of CPython:$ graalpython -m venv my_new_venv$ source my_new_venv/bin/activateTo see the list of installable packages, run:$ graalpython -m ginstall install --helpThis will print a short help including a comma-separated list of packages youcan install. The installation works as described in that help:$ graalpython -m ginstall install pandasNote that when using the GraalVM implementation of Python from Java, thepolyglot shell, or another language, you should always evaluate the piece ofPython code first to make installed packages available:import siteInteroperabilityGraalVM supports several other programming languages, including JavaScript, R,Ruby, and LLVM. GraalVM provides a Python API to interact with other languagesavailable on the GraalVM. In fact, GraalVM uses this API internally toexecute Python C extensions using the LLVM implementation in GraalVM.To run the following script, pass the --jvm --polyglot options tograalpython binary. This makes other GraalVM languages available in scripts.As a simple example, we can use the JavaScript regular expression engine tomatch Python strings:import polyglotre = polyglot.eval(string=&quot;RegExp()&quot;, language=&quot;js&quot;)pattern = re.compile(&quot;.*(?:we have (?:a )?matching strings?(?:[!?] )?)(.*)&quot;)if pattern.exec(&quot;This string does not match&quot;):    raise SystemError(&quot;that shouldn&#39;t happen&quot;)md = pattern.exec(&quot;Look, we have matching strings! This string was matched by Graal.js&quot;)if not md:    raise SystemError(&quot;this should have matched&quot;)print(&quot;Here is what we found: &#39;%s&#39;&quot; % md[1])If you put this code into a file polyglot_example.py, you can run it with:$ graalpython --jvm --polyglot polyglot_example.pyThis example matches Python strings using the JavaScript regular expression objectand Python reads the captured group from the JavaScript result and prints: Hereis what we found: &#39;This string was matched by Graal.js&#39;.As a more complex example, we can read a file using R, process the data inPython, and use R again to display the resulting data image, using both R andPython libraries in conjunction. To run it, first install therequired R library:$ R -e &#39;install.packages(&quot;https://www.rforge.net/src/contrib/jpeg_0.1-8.tar.gz&quot;, repos=NULL)&#39;This example also uses image_magix.py and workson a JPEG image input. (You can try with thisimage, for example). These files haveto be in the same folder the script below is located in and executed from.import polyglotimport sysimport timesys.path.insert(0, &quot;.&quot;)from image_magix import Imageload_jpeg = polyglot.eval(string=&quot;&quot;&quot;function(file.name) {    library(jpeg)    jimg &amp;lt;- readJPEG(file.name)    jimg &amp;lt;- jimg*255    jimg}&quot;&quot;&quot;, language=&quot;R&quot;)raw_data = load_jpeg(&quot;python_demo_picture.jpg&quot;)# the dimensions are R attributes; define function to access themgetDim = polyglot.eval(string=&quot;function(v, pos) dim(v)[[pos]]&quot;, language=&quot;R&quot;)# Create object of Python class &#39;Image&#39; with loaded JPEG dataimage = Image(getDim(raw_data, 2), getDim(raw_data, 1), raw_data)# Run Sobel filterresult = image.sobel()draw = polyglot.eval(string=&quot;&quot;&quot;function(processedImgObj) {    require(grDevices)    require(grid)    mx &amp;lt;- matrix(processedImgObj$`@data`/255, nrow=processedImgObj$`@height`, ncol=processedImgObj$`@width`)    grDevices:::awt()    grid.raster(mx, height=unit(nrow(mx),&quot;points&quot;))}&quot;&quot;&quot;, language=&quot;R&quot;)draw(result)time.sleep(10)See the Polyglot Reference and theEmbedding documentationfor more information about interoperability with other programming languages.ToolingAlthough GraalVM’s Python implementation is far from complete and cannot run the standard Pythondebugger pdb, the tools that GraalVM itself provides do work.To debug applications in the Chrome browser, for example, you can run a script like so:$ graalpython --inspect [script-to-debug.py]Debugger listening on port 9229.To start debugging, open the following URL in Chrome:    chrome-devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?ws=127.0.0.1:9229/15615099-351e94d1e2dbPlease note: This Python implementation is in the very early stages, and can run little more than basic benchmarks at this point.The graalpython --help:tools command will give you more informationabout tools currently supported on Python.Native Images and JVM RuntimeBy default, GraalVM runs Python from an ahead-of-time compiled binary, yieldingfaster startup time and lower footprint. However, the ahead-of-time compiledbinary only includes the Python and LLVM interpreters. To interoperate withother languages, we had to supply the --jvm argument above. This instructs thelauncher to run on the JVM instead of in the Native Image mode – you will notice alonger startup time.Python CompatibilityIs GraalVM compatible with the Python language?GraalVM’s implementation of Python is in the early stages of development. A primary goal is to supportSciPy and its constituent libraries, but we have a long way to go there. At thispoint, the Python implementation is made available for experimentation andcurious end-users. GraalVM currently aims to be compatible with Python 3.7,but it is a long way from there, and it is very likely that any Python programthat requires any imports at all will hit something unsupported.Is there any progress in GraalVM and Python packages compatibility?It is too early to claim that there are any Python packages that GraalVM iscompatible with.Python Command OptionsPython is run using the graalpython [option] ... (-c cmd | file) [arg] ... commandsequence and supports some of the same options as the standard Pythoninterpreter including, but not limited to:  -c cmd: pass a program as String and terminate options list  -h, --help: print the help message and exit  -i, PYTHONINSPECT=x: inspect interactively after running a script and force a prompt even ifstdin does not appear to be a terminal  -V, --version: print the Python version number and exit  file: read a program from the script file  arg ...: arguments passed to program in sys.argv[1:]The following options are mostly useful for developers of the language or toprovide bug reports:  --python.CoreHome=&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;: The path to the core library of Pythonthat is written in Python. This usually resides in a folderlib-graalpython in the GraalVM distribution.  --python.StdLibHome=&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;: The path to the standard library thatPython will use. Usually this is in a under lib-python/3 in theGraalVM distribution, but any Python 3.7 standard library location may work.  --python.WithJavaStacktrace: Prints a Java-level stack trace besides thenormal Python stack when errors occur.There are a few other debugging options used by the developers of GraalVM,but these change frequently and may not do anything at any given point in time,so any observed effects of them should not be relied upon.",

                    "content": "IntroductionGraalVM allows you to write polyglot applications with a seamless way to pass values from one language to another.With GraalVM there is no copying or marshalling necessary as it is with other polyglot systems.This lets you achieve high performance when language boundaries are crossed.Most of the time there is no additional cost for crossing a language boundary at all.Often developers have to make uncomfortable compromises that require them to rewrite their software in other languages. For example:  “That library is not available in my language. I need to rewrite it.”  “That language would be the perfect fit for my problem, but we cannot run it in our environment.”  “That problem is already solved in my language, but the language is too slow.”With GraalVM we aim to allow developers to freely choose the right language for the task at hand without making compromises.Throughout this section you learn how to combine multiple languages using our polyglot APIs.Running Polyglot ApplicationsThe following examples are designed to get you started with a basic polyglot application.Select a section for your Start Language and then select a tab for the Target Language.Ensure you set up GraalVM and export the GraalVM home directory as the $GRAALVM_HOME before you begin. See Get Started.Note that these examples work in all scenarios:  On JVM, by passing --polyglot --jvm.  On native launchers with --polyglot (e.g., js --polyglot).Note that it might be required to rebuild images to access languages installed with gu.  With native image executables (e.g., native-image --language:js).For native launchers and native image executables using Java as the Target Languageand accessing other classes than Java arrays, it is required to recompile the image and providea reflection configuration file.Requirement: to start an application with LLVM as a Target Language, make sure to precompile polyglot.c file provided below.Start from JavaScript / Node.jsCreate a file polyglot.js:                                  // BEGIN-SNIPPETvar array = Polyglot.eval(&quot;R&quot;, &quot;c(1,2,42,4)&quot;)console.log(array[2]);// END-SNIPPET                                            // BEGIN-SNIPPETvar array = Polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)console.log(array[2]);// END-SNIPPET                                            // BEGIN-SNIPPETvar array = Polyglot.eval(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)console.log(array[2]);// END-SNIPPET                                            // BEGIN-SNIPPETvar array = new (Java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;))(4);array[2] = 42;console.log(array[2])// END-SNIPPET                                            // BEGIN-SNIPPETvar cpart = Polyglot.evalFile(&quot;llvm&quot;, &quot;polyglot&quot;);cpart.main()// END-SNIPPET              R      Ruby      Python      Java      LLVM            Target Language      Run:$ js --polyglot --jvm polyglot.js42$ node --polyglot --jvm polyglot.js42Start Language RCreate a file polyglot.R:                                   # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)print(array[3L])# END-SNIPPET                                               # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)print(array[3L])# END-SNIPPET                                               # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)print(array[3L])# END-SNIPPET                                               # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray &amp;lt;- new(&quot;int[]&quot;, 4)array[3L] &amp;lt;- 42print(array[3L])# END-SNIPPET                                               # BEGIN-SNIPPETcpart &amp;lt;- eval.polyglot(&quot;llvm&quot;, path=&quot;polyglot&quot;)cpart$main()# END-SNIPPET                JS      Ruby      Python      Java      LLVM            Target Language      Run:$ Rscript --polyglot --jvm polyglot.R[1] 42Start Language Ruby:Create a file polyglot.rb:                                  # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray = Polyglot.eval(&#39;js&#39;, &#39;[1,2,42,4]&#39;)puts array[2]# END-SNIPPET                                              # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray = Polyglot.eval(&#39;R&#39;, &#39;c(1L,2L,42L,4L)&#39;)puts array[2]# END-SNIPPET                                              # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray = Polyglot.eval(&#39;python&#39;, &#39;[1,2,42,4]&#39;)puts array[2]# END-SNIPPET                                              # BEGIN-SNIPPETarray = Java.type(&#39;int[]&#39;).new(4)array[2] = 42print(array[2])# END-SNIPPET                                              # BEGIN-SNIPPETcpart = Polyglot.eval_file(&#39;llvm&#39;, &#39;polyglot&#39;)cpart.main()# END-SNIPPET                JS      R      Python      Java      LLVM            Target Language      Run:$ ruby --polyglot --jvm polyglot.rb42Start Language Python:Create a file polyglot.py:                                  # BEGIN-SNIPPETimport polyglotarray = polyglot.eval(language=&quot;js&quot;, string=&quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)print(array[2])# END-SNIPPET                                            # BEGIN-SNIPPETimport polyglotarray = polyglot.eval(language=&quot;R&quot;, string=&quot;c(1L,2L,42L,4L)&quot;)print(array[2])# END-SNIPPET                                            # BEGIN-SNIPPETimport polyglotarray = polyglot.eval(language=&quot;ruby&quot;, string=&quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;)print(array[2])# END-SNIPPET                                            # BEGIN-SNIPPETimport javaarray = java.type(&quot;int[]&quot;)(4)array[2] = 42print(array[2])# END-SNIPPET                                            # BEGIN-SNIPPETimport polyglotcpart = polyglot.eval(language=&quot;llvm&quot;, path=&quot;polyglot&quot;)cpart.main()# END-SNIPPET              JS      R      Ruby      Java      LLVM            Target Language      Run:$ graalpython --polyglot --jvm polyglot.py42Start Language Java:Create a file Polyglot.java:                                  // BEGIN-SNIPPETimport org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class Polyglot {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.create();

Thisinteroperability protocol consists of a set of standardized messages that everylanguage implements and uses for foreign polyglot values. The protocol allowsGraalVM to support interoperability between any combination of languages withoutrequiring them to know of each other. We plan to gradually improve the protocolto support more and more features over time.For further details, we recommend reading:  Matthias Grimmer, Chris Seaton, Roland Schatz, Würthinger, Hanspeter MössenböckHigh-Performance Cross-Language Interoperability in a Multi-Language RuntimeIn Proceedings of the 11th Dynamic Language Symposium (DLS).Running Polyglot ApplicationsWith polyglot applications it is often impossible to decide what the primarylanguage of an application is. Therefore, we have added an experimental newlauncher called polyglot to GraalVM. For the moment, this launcher runs codefor JavaScript, Ruby, and R without requiring the selection of a primarylanguage. The polyglot launcher does not require the --polyglot option, it isenabled by default.This is how you can run a polyglot application by using the examples from above:$ polyglot --jvm polyglot.js polyglot.R polyglot.rbWe have also included a basic experimental shell for multiple languages calledthe Polyglot Shell. It is useful to quickly test to test the interactivity oflanguages implemented with the Truffle Language Implementation framework.This is how you can start it:$ polyglot --jvm --shellGraalVM MultiLanguage Shell 20.1.0  JavaScript version 20.1.0  Python version 3.8.2  R version 3.6.1  Ruby version 2.6.5Usage:  Use Ctrl+L to switch language and Ctrl+D to exit.  Enter -usage to get a list of available commands.js&amp;gt;Note: The polyglot launcher and the Polyglot Shell are experimental features in GraalVM.Polyglot OptionsYou can configure language engine for better throughput or startup.  --engine.Mode=default: Configures the execution mode of the engine. The execution mode automatically tunes the polyglot engine towards latency or throughput.          throughput: To collect the maximum amount of profiling information and compile using the  maximum number of optimizations. This mode results in slower application startup  but better throughput. This mode uses the compiler configuration community or   enterprise if not specified otherwise.      default: To use a balanced engine configuration. This mode uses the compiler configuration community or enterprise if not specified otherwise.      latency: To collect only minimal profiling information and compile as fast as possible  with less optimal generated code. This mode results in faster application  startup but less optimal throughput. This mode uses the compiler configuration  economy if not specified otherwise.      Polyglot Options for Language LaunchersWe have extended every language launcher with a set of so called polyglotoptions. Polyglot options allow users of any language launcher to access theoptions of other languages supported by GraalVM (implemented with the TruffleLanguage Implementation Framework).The format is: --&amp;lt;languageID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.For example the R launcher also supports the --js.atomics=true JavaScript option.Allowed values for the languageID are:  js options for JavaScript.  python options for Python.  r options for R.  ruby options for Ruby.  llvm options for LLVM.Use --help:languages to find out which options are available.Options for polyglot tools work in the same way with the following format: --&amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.Allowed values for &amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt; are:  inspect allows debugging with Chrome DevTools.  cpusampler collects data about CPU usage.  cputracer captures trace information about CPU usage.  memtracer captures trace information about memory usage.Use --help:tools to find out which options are available.Passing Options ProgrammaticallyOptions can also be passed programmatically using the Java polyglot API.Create a file called OptionsTest.java:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class OptionsTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowExperimentalOptions(true)            .option(&quot;js.shared-array-buffer&quot;, &quot;true&quot;)            .build();        // the use of shared array buffer requires        // the &#39;js.shared-array-buffer&#39; option to be &#39;true&#39;        polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;new SharedArrayBuffer(1024)&quot;);    }}Run:$ javac OptionsTest.java$ java OptionsTestPlease note that tool options can be passed in the same way.Options cannot be modified after the context was created.Passing Options using JVM ArgumentsEvery polyglot option can also be passed as a Java system property.Each available option translates to a system property with the polyglot. prefix.For example: -Dpolyglot.js.strict=true sets the default value for a strict interpretation for all JavaScript code that runs in the JVM.Options that were set programmatically take precedence over Java system properties.For languages the following format can be used: -Dpolyglot.&amp;lt;languageID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt; and for tools it is: -Dpolyglot.&amp;lt;toolID&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;property&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;.Create a file called SystemPropertiesTest.java:import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class SystemPropertiesTest {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowExperimentalOptions(true).build();        // the use of shared array buffer requires        // the &#39;js.shared-array-buffer&#39; option to be &#39;true&#39;        polyglot.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;new SharedArrayBuffer(1024)&quot;);    }}Run:$ javac SystemPropertiesTest.java$ java -Dpolyglot.js.strict=true SystemPropertiesTestNote: System properties are read once when the polyglot context is created. Subsequent changes have no effect.",

                    "content": "A short introduction to GraalVMGraalVM is an ecosystem and shared runtime offering performance advantages notonly to JVM-based languages such as Java, Scala, and Kotlin, but also to otherprogramming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and R. Additionally, itenables the execution of native code via an LLVM front-end, andWebAssembly programs on the JVM.The preceding diagram illustrates the architecture of GraalVM as an open ecosystem.The virtualization layer represents programming languages, provided by GraalVM.The execution of guest programming languages, namely JavaScript, Ruby, R, Pythonand LLVM bitcode, in the same runtime as the host JVM-based application is now down-to-earth.The host language and guest languages can directly interoperate with each otherand pass data back and forth in the same memory space.The bottom part demonstrates the applicability range. GraalVM can either run standalone,be embedded as part of the OpenJDK or Node.js platforms,or even execute inside Oracle Database.GraalVM DistributionsGraalVM 20.1.0 is distributed as the Community Editionand the Enterprise Edition bundled for Linux, macOS and Windows platforms onx86 64-bit systems. GraalVM builds are based on JDK 8 and on JDK 11.

                    "content": "Migration from JRuby to TruffleRubyWe recommend that people trying TruffleRuby on their gems and applicationsget in touch with us for help.DeploymentIf you are migrating from JRuby probably the easiest way to use TruffleRuby isvia GraalVM, which gives you a JVM,JavaScript, Ruby and other languages in one package.If you don’t need the Java interop capabilities of TruffleRuby then you couldalso install via your Ruby manager/installeras any other implementation of Ruby.You can also use the standalone distribution asa simple tarball. The standalone distribution doesn’t allow for Java interop.Using Ruby from JavaJRuby supports many different ways to embed Ruby in Java, including JSR 223(also know as javax.script), the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF), JRuby Embed(also known as Red Bridge), and the JRuby direct embedding API.We recommend that TruffleRuby is embedded via the Polyglot API, which is part ofGraalVM. The API is different because it’s designed to support many languages,not just Ruby.TruffleRuby also supports JSR 223, compatible with JRuby, to make iteasier to run legacy JRuby code.You will need to use the GraalVM to use both of these APIs.See the polyglot documentation for more information about how touse Ruby from other languages including Java - this document only shows thecomparison to JRuby.Creating a contextIn JRuby with JSR 223 where you would have written:ScriptEngineManager m = new ScriptEngineManager();ScriptEngine scriptEngine = m.getEngineByName(&quot;ruby&quot;);Or with BSF where you would have written:BSFManager.registerScriptingEngine(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;org.jruby.embed.bsf.JRubyEngine&quot;, null);BSFManager bsfManager = new BSFManager();Or with JRuby Embed where you would have written:ScriptingContainer container = new ScriptingContainer();Or with the direct embedding API where you would have written:Ruby ruby = Ruby.newInstance(new RubyInstanceConfig());In TruffleRuby you now write:Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();allowAllAccess(true) allows the permissive access privileges that Ruby needsfor full functionality. GraalVM by default disallows many privileges which maynot be safe, such as native file access, but a normal Ruby installation usesthese so we enable them. You can decide to not grant those privileges, but thiswill restrict some of Ruby’s functionality.Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().build(); // No privileges granted, restricts functionalityYou would normally create your context inside a try block to ensure it isproperly disposed.try (Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build()) {}See the Context APIfor detailed documentation about Context.Setting optionsYou can set TruffleRuby options via system properties, or via the.option(name, value) builder method.Evaluating codeIn JRuby where you would have written one of these (each time we show the JRuby example we’ll show one of the options available on each line):scriptEngine.eval(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);bsfManager.exec(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);container.runScriptlet(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);In TruffleRuby you now write this:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);Note that eval supports multiple languages, so you need to specify thelanguage each time.Evaluating code with parametersIn JRuby with JSR 223 you can pass parameters, called bindings, into a script.Bindings bindings = scriptEngine.createBindings();bindings.put(&quot;a&quot;, 14);bindings.put(&quot;b&quot;, 2);scriptEngine.eval(&quot;puts a + b&quot;, bindings);In TruffleRuby the eval method does not take parameters. Instead you shouldreturn a proc which does take parameters, and then call execute on this value.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; a, b { puts a + b }&quot;).execute(14, 2);Primitive valuesThe different embedding APIs handle primitive values in different ways. In JSR223, BSF, and JRuby Embed, the return type is Object and can be cast to aprimitive like long and checked with instanceof. In the direct embedding APIthe return is the root IRubyObject interface and you will need to convert aprimitive to an Integer, and from there to a Java long.(long) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;14 + 2&quot;);(long) bsfManager.eval(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;14 + 2&quot;);(long) container.runScriptlet(&quot;14 + 2&quot;);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;14 + 2&quot;).convertToInteger().getLongValue();In TruffleRuby the return value is always an encapsulated Value object, whichcan be accessed as a long if that is possible for the object. fitsInLong()can test this.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;14 + 2&quot;).asLong();Calling methodsTo call a method on an object you get from an eval, or any other object, inthe JRuby embedding APIs you either need to ask the context to invoke themethod, or in the case of direct embedding you need to call a method on thereceiver and marshal the arguments into JRuby types yourself. The BSF doesn’tappear to have a way to call methods.((Invocable) scriptEngine).invokeMethod(scriptEngine.eval(&quot;Math&quot;), &quot;sin&quot;, 2);container.callMethod(container.runScriptlet(&quot;Math&quot;), &quot;sin&quot;, 2);ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;Math&quot;).callMethod(ruby.getCurrentContext(), &quot;sin&quot;, new IRubyObject[]{ruby.newFixnum(2)})In TruffleRuby the Value class has a getMember method to return Ruby methodson an object, which you can then call by calling execute. You don’t need tomarshal the arguments.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;Math&quot;).getMember(&quot;sin&quot;).execute(2);To call methods on a primitive, use a lambda:polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; x { x.succ }&quot;).execute(2).asInt();Passing blocksBlocks are a Ruby-specific language feature, so they don’t appear in languageagnostic APIs like JSR 223 and BSF. The JRuby Embed API and direct embedding doallow passing a Block parameter to the callMethod method, but it’s notclear how you would create a Block object to use this.In TruffleRuby you should return a Ruby lambda that performs your call, passinga block that executes a Java lambda that you pass in.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; block { (1..3).each { |n| block.call n } }&quot;)  .execute(polyglot.asValue((IntConsumer) n -&amp;gt; System.out.println(n)));Creating objectsJRuby embedding APIs don’t have support for creating new objects, but you canjust call the new method yourself.((Invocable) scriptEngine).invokeMethod(scriptEngine.eval(&quot;Time&quot;), &quot;new&quot;, 2021, 3, 18);container.callMethod(container.runScriptlet(&quot;Time&quot;), &quot;new&quot;, 2021, 3, 18)ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;Time&quot;).callMethod(ruby.getCurrentContext(), &quot;new&quot;,  new IRubyObject[]{ruby.newFixnum(2021), ruby.newFixnum(3), ruby.newFixnum(8)})In TruffleRuby you can create an object from a Ruby class using newInstance.You can use canInstantiate to see if this will be possible.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;).newInstance(2021, 3, 18);Handling stringsIn JRuby’s embedding APIs you would use toString to convert to a JavaString. Use asString in TruffleRuby (and isString to check).Accessing arraysJRuby’s arrays implement List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;, so you can cast to this interface toaccess them.((List) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) container.runScriptlet(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) bsfManager.eval(&quot;jruby&quot;, &quot;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;&quot;, 1, 0, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);((List) ruby.evalScriptlet(&quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;)).get(1);In TruffleRuby you can use getArrayElement, setArrayElement, andgetArraySize, or you can use as(List.class) to get a List&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;.polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;).getArrayElement(1);polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[3, 4, 5]&quot;).as(List.class).get(1);Accessing hashesJRuby’s hashes implement Map&amp;lt;Object, Object&amp;gt;, so you can cast to thisinterface to access them.((Map) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;{&#39;a&#39; =&amp;gt; 3, &#39;b&#39; =&amp;gt; 4, &#39;c&#39; =&amp;gt; 5}&quot;)).get(&quot;b&quot;);((Map) scriptEngine.eval(&quot;{3 =&amp;gt; &#39;a&#39;, 4 =&amp;gt; &#39;b&#39;, 5 =&amp;gt; &#39;c&#39;}&quot;)).get(4);In TruffleRuby there is currently no uniform way to access hashes ordictionary-like data structures. At the moment we recommend using a lambdaaccessor.Value hash = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;{&#39;a&#39; =&amp;gt; 3, &#39;b&#39; =&amp;gt; 4, &#39;c&#39; =&amp;gt; 5}&quot;);Value accessor = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; hash, key { hash[key] }&quot;);accessor.execute(hash, &quot;b&quot;);Implementing interfacesYou may want to implement a Java interface using a Ruby object (example copiedfrom the JRuby wiki).interface FluidForce {  double getFluidForce(double a, double b, double depth);}class EthylAlcoholFluidForce  def getFluidForce(x, y, depth)    area = Math::PI * x * y    49.4 * area * depth  endendEthylAlcoholFluidForce.newString RUBY_SOURCE = &quot;class EthylAlcoholFluidForcen  def getFluidForce...&quot;;In JSR 223 you can use getInterface(object, Interface.class), in JRuby Embedyou can use getInstance(object, Interface.class), and in direct embeddingyou can use toJava(Interface.class). BSF does not appear to supportimplementing interfaces.FluidForce fluidForce = ((Invocable) scriptEngine).getInterface(scriptEngine.eval(RUBY_SOURCE), FluidForce.class);       FluidForce fluidForce = container.getInstance(container.runScriptlet(RUBY_SOURCE), FluidForce.class);FluidForce fluidForce = ruby.evalScriptlet(RUBY_SOURCE).toJava(FluidForce.class);fluidForce.getFluidForce(2.0, 3.0, 6.0);In TruffleRuby you can get an interface implemented by your Ruby objectby using as(Interface.class).FluidForce fluidForce = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, RUBY_SOURCE).as(FluidForce.class);fluidForce.getFluidForce(2.0, 3.0, 6.0);JRuby allows the name of the Ruby method to be get_fluid_force, using Rubyconventions, instead of getFluidForce, using Java conventions. TruffleRubydoes not support this at the moment.Implementing lambdasAs far as we know, JSR 223, BSF, JRuby Embed and direct embedding do not have aconvenient way to get a Java lambda from a Ruby lambda.In TruffleRuby you can get a Java lambda (really an implementation of afunctional interface) from a Ruby lambda by usingas(FunctionalInterface.class).BiFunction&amp;lt;Integer, Integer, Integer&amp;gt; adder = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; a, b { a + b }&quot;).as(BiFunction.class);adder.apply(14, 2).intValue();Parse once run many timesSome of the JRuby embedding APIs allow a script to be compiled once and theneval’d several times.CompiledScript compiled = ((Compilable) scriptEngine).compile(&quot;puts &#39;hello&#39;&quot;);compiled.eval();In TruffleRuby you can simply return a lambda from parsing and execute thismany times. It will be subject to optimisation like any other Ruby code.Value parsedOnce = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;-&amp;gt; { run many times }&quot;);parsedOnce.execute();Using Java from RubyTruffleRuby provides its own scheme for Java interop that is consistent foruse from any GraalVM language, to any other GraalVM language. This isn’tcompatible with existing JRuby Java interop, so you will need to migrate.Polyglot programming in general is documented elsewhere - thissection describes it relative to JRuby.This example is from the JRuby wiki:# This is the &#39;magical Java require line&#39;.require &#39;java&#39;# With the &#39;require&#39; above, we can now refer to things that are part of the# standard Java platform via their full paths.frame = javax.swing.JFrame.new(&quot;Window&quot;) # Creating a Java JFramelabel = javax.swing.JLabel.new(&quot;Hello&quot;)# We can transparently call Java methods on Java objects, just as if they were defined in Ruby.frame.add(label)  # Invoking the Java method &#39;add&#39;.frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(javax.swing.JFrame::EXIT_ON_CLOSE)frame.packframe.setVisible(true)In TruffleRuby we would write that this way instead:Java.import &#39;javax.swing.JFrame&#39;Java.import &#39;javax.swing.JLabel&#39;frame = JFrame.new(&quot;Window&quot;)label = JLabel.new(&quot;Hello&quot;)frame.add(label)frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame[:EXIT_ON_CLOSE])frame.packframe.setVisible(true)Instead of using Ruby metaprogramming to simulate a Java package name, weexplicitly import classes. Java.import is similar to JRuby’s java_import,and does ::ClassName = Java.type(&#39;package.ClassName&#39;).Constants are read by reading properties of the class rather than using Rubynotation.Require JavaDo not require &#39;java&#39; in TruffleRuby. However, you do need to run in --jvmmode. This is only available in GraalVM - not in the standalone distributioninstalled by Ruby version managers and installers.Referring to classesIn JRuby Java classes can either be referenced in the Java module, such asJava::ComFoo::Bar, or if they have a common TLD they can be referenced ascom.foo.Bar. java_import com.foo.Bar will define Bar as a top-levelconstant.In TruffleRuby Java classes are referred to using eitherJava.type(&#39;com.foo.Bar&#39;), which you would then normally assign to a constant,or you can use Java.import &#39;com.foo.Bar&#39; to have Bar defined as a top-levelconstant.Wildcard package importsJRuby lets you include_package &#39;com.foo&#39; which will make all classes in thatpackage available as constants in the current scope.In TruffleRuby you refer to classes explicitly.Calling methods and creating instancesIn both JRuby and TruffleRuby you call Java methods as you would a Ruby method.JRuby will rewrite method names such as my_method to the Java convention ofmyMethod, and converts getFoo to foo, and setFoo to foo=. TruffleRubydoes not do these conversions.Referring to constantsIn JRuby, Java constants are modelled as Ruby constants, MyClass::FOO. InTruffleRuby you use the read notation to read them as a property,MyClass[:FOO].Using classes from jar filesIn JRuby you can add classes and jars to the classpath using require. InTruffleRuby at the moment you use the -classpath JVM flag as normal.Additional Java-specific methodsJRuby defines these methods on Java objects, use these equivalents instead.java_class - use class.java_kind_of? - use is_a?java_object - not supported.java_send - use __send__.java_method - not supported.java_alias - not supported.Creating Java arraysIn JRuby you use Java::byte[1024].new.In TruffleRuby you would use Java.type(&#39;byte[]&#39;).new(1024)Implementing Java interfacesJRuby has several ways to implement an interface. For example to add an actionlistener to a Swing button we could do any of these three things.class ClickAction  include java.awt.event.ActionListener  def actionPerformed(event)   javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;  endendbutton.addActionListener ClickAction.newbutton.addActionListener do |event|  javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;endbutton.addActionListener -&amp;gt; event {  javax.swing.JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;}In TruffleRuby we’d always use the last option to generate an interface.button.addActionListener -&amp;gt; event {  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog nil, &#39;hello&#39;}Generating Java classes at runtimeJRuby supports converting a Ruby class to a concrete Java class using become_java!.TruffleRuby does not support this. We recommend using a proper Java interface asyour interface between Java and Ruby.Reopening Java classesJava classes cannot be re-opened in TruffleRuby.Subclassing Java classesJava classes cannot be subclassed in TruffleRuby. Use composition or interfacesinstead.Extending TruffleRuby Using JavaJRuby supports extensions written in Java. These extensions are written againstan informal interface that is simply the entire internals of JRuby, similar tohow the MRI C extension interface works.TruffleRuby does not support writing these kind of Java extensions at themoment. We recommend using Java interop as described above.ToolingStandalone classes and jarsJRuby supports compiling to standalone source classes and compiled jarsfrom Ruby using jrubyc.TruffleRuby does not support compiling Ruby code to Java. We recommend using thePolyglot API as your entry point from Java to Ruby.WarblerJRuby supports building war files for loading into enterprise Java web servers.TruffleRuby does not support this at the moment.VisualVMVisualVM works for TruffleRuby as for JRuby.Additionally, the VisualVM included in GraalVM understands Ruby objects, ratherthan Java objects, when you use the heap dump tool.",

Trying to use level 1 will raise a SecurityError.Other levels will raise ArgumentError as in standard Ruby.MRI VulnerabilitiesVulnerabilities reported against MRI may apply to the design of Ruby or tocode that we share with MRI.

You can manually execute javac ListDir.java, there isalso a build.sh script included for your convenience. Note that you can useany JDK for compiling the Java classes, however we refer to javac from GraalVMin the build script to simplify the prerequisites and not to depend on anotherJDK installed.    Having downloaded and unzipped GraalVM Community or GraalVM Enterprise archive, export the GraalVM home directory as the $GRAALVM_HOME and add $GRAALVM_HOME/binto the path, using a command-line shell for Linux:    export GRAALVM_HOME=/home/${current_user}/path/to/graalvm    and for macOS:    export GRAALVM_HOME=/Users/${current_user}/path/to/graalvm/Contents/Home    Note that your paths are likely to be different depending on the download location.        Install Native Image to make use of the native-image utility.    Then execute:    ./build.sh  The build.sh script creates a native image from the Java class.Let us look at it in more detail:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image ListDirThe native-image utility ahead-of-time compiles the ListDir class into astandalone binary in the current working directory. After running thecommand, an executable file listdir should have been produced.Running the ApplicationTo run the application, you need to either execute the ListDir class,as a normal Java application using java, or, since we have a native imageprepared, run that directly.The run.sh file, executes both, and times them with the time utility.time java ListDir $1time ./listdir $1To make it more interesting, pass it to a parent directory: ./run.sh .. (.. - isthe parent of the current directory, the one containing all the demos).Approximately, the following output should be produced:java ListDir ..Walking path: ..Total: 141 files, total size = 14448801 bytesreal0m0.320suser0m0.379ssys0m0.070s./listDir ..Walking path: ..Total: 141 files, total size = 14448801 bytesreal0m0.030suser0m0.005ssys0m0.011sThe performance gain of the native version is largely due to the faster startup.Polyglot CapabilitiesYou can also experiment with a more sophisticated ExtListDir example,which uses Java/JavaScript polyglot capabilities.To compile that class you need to add graal-sdk.jar on the classpath:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/javac -cp $GRAALVM_HOME/jre/lib/boot/graal-sdk.jar ExtListDir.javaBuilding the native image command is similar to the one above, but, since we want to use JavaScript, we need to inform the native-image utility about it by passing the --language:js option.Note that it takes a bit more time because it needs to include the JavaScript support.$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --language:js ExtListDirThe execution is the same as in the previous example:time java ExtListDir $1time ./extlistdir $1Profile-Guided Optimizations for High ThroughputGraalVM Enterprise Edition offers extra benefits for building a native image. These are profile-guided optimisations (PGO). As an example we will use a small application demonstrating Java streams.First, we run the application with java to see the output:javac Streams.java$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image Streams./streams 1000000 200...Iteration 20 finished in 1955 milliseconds with checksum 6e36c560485cdc01To enable PGO we need to build an instrumented image and run it to collect profiles:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --pgo-instrument Streams./streams 1000 200Profiles collected from this run are now stored in the default.iprof file. Note that we run the profiling with a much smaller data size.Now we can use these profiles to make an optimized image:$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/native-image --pgo StreamsWhen we run the PGO image with./streams 1000000 200...Iteration 20 finished in 827 milliseconds with checksum 6e36c560485cdc01we will see more than 2x improvements in performance.",

                    "content": "Generating Heap Dumps from Native ImagesGraalVM allows to create highly performing native applications with thethe Native Image technology. It is also possibleto generate heap dumps of the native image processes to monitor the execution.This functionality is available only with GraalVM Enterprise.Native Image does not implement JVMTI agent and it is not possible to triggerheap dump creation using tools like Visual VM or jmap. You can build the image for your application in a way so that it can handle certain signals and then get a heapdump when the application receives the USR1 signal (other supported signals are QUIT/BREAK for stackdumps and USR2 to dump runtime compilation info). You only need to build your image with GraalVM Enterprise Native Image and use the -H:+AllowVMInspection option. Another possibility is towrite a special method which will generate a heap dump at certain points in thelifetime of your application. For example, when certain conditions are met whilerunning the native image, your application code can trigger heap dump creation.A dedicated org.graalvm.nativeimage.VMRuntime#dumpHeap API exists for thispurpose. We will show both possibilities in this chapter.Handle SIGUSR1 SignalThe following Java example is a simple multi-threaded application which runs for60 seconds. There is enough time to get its PID and send the SIGUSR1 signalwhich will generate a heap dump into the application’s working directory.

Finally, options can be set asGraalVM polyglot API configuration options.The priority for options is the command line first, then the Graal-SDK polyglotAPI configuration, then system properties last.TruffleRuby options, as well as conventional Ruby options and VM options, canalso be set in the TRUFFLERUBYOPT and RUBYOPT environment variables, ifrun from the Ruby launcher.-- or the first non-option argument stops processing of TrufflRuby and VMoptions in the same way it stops processing of Ruby arguments.VM OptionsTo set options in the underlying VM, use --vm., valid for both the nativeconfiguration and the JVM configuration.For example --vm.Dsystem_property=value or --vm.ea.To set the classpath, use the = notation, rather than two separate arguments.For example --vm.cp=lib.jar or --vm.classpath=lib.jar.Other Binary SwitchesOther binaries, such as irb, gem, and so on, support exactly the sameswitches as in standard Ruby.Determining the TruffleRuby HomeTruffleRuby needs to know where to locate files such as the standard library.These are stored in the TruffleRuby home directory.The Ruby home is always the one that the Truffle framework reports.If the Ruby home appears to not be correct or is unset a warning will be given butthe program will continue and you will not be able to require standardlibraries.

This is similar to most REPL semantics.Loading Code Written in Foreign LanguagesPolyglot.eval(id, string) executes code in a foreign language identified byits ID.Polyglot.eval_file(id, path) executes code in a foreign language from a file,identified by its language ID.Polyglot.eval_file(path) executes code in a foreign language from a file,automatically determining the language.Exporting Ruby Objects to Foreign LanguagesPolyglot.export(name, value) exports a value with a given name.Polyglot.export_method(name) exports a method, defined in the top-levelobject.Importing Foreign Objects to RubyPolyglot.import(name) imports and returns a value with a given name.Polyglot.import_method(name) imports a value, which should be IS_EXECUTABLE,with a given name, and defines it in the top-level object.Using Ruby Objects from a Foreign LanguageUsing JavaScript as an example - the left example is JavaScript, the right oneis the corresponding action it takes on the Ruby object expressed in Ruby code.object[name/index] calls object[name/index] if the object has a method [],or reads an instance variable if the name starts with @, or returns a boundmethod with the name.object[name/index] = value calls object[name/index] = value if the objecthas a method []=, or sets an instance variable if the name starts with @.delete object.name calls object.delete(name).delete object[name/index] calls object.delete(name).object.length calls object.size.Object.keys(hash) gives the hash keys as strings.Object.keys(object) gives the methods of an object as functions, unless theobject has a [] method, in which case it returns an empty array.object(args...) calls a Ruby Proc, Method, UnboundMethod, etc.object.name(args...) calls a method on the Ruby object.new object(args...) calls object.new(args...).&quot;length&quot; in obj returns true for a Ruby Array.object == null calls object.nil?.Notes on creating Ruby objects for use in foreign languagesIf you want to pass a Ruby object to another language for fields to be read andwritten, a good object to pass is usually a Struct, as this will have both theobject.foo and object.foo = value accessors for you to use from Ruby, andthey will also respond to object[&#39;foo&#39;] and object[&#39;foo&#39;] = value whichmeans they will work from other languages sending read and write messages.Using Foreign Objects from Rubyobject[name/index] will read a member from the foreign object.object[name/index] = value will write a value to the the foreign object.object.delete(name/index) will remove a value from the foreign object.object.size will get the size or length of the foreign object.object.keys will get an array of the members of the foreign object.object.call(*args) will execute the foreign object.object.name(*args) will invoke a method called name on the foreign object.object.new(*args) will create a new object from the foreign object (as if it’ssome kind of class.)object.class on a Java Class object will give you an object on which youcan call instance methods, rather than static methods.object.respond_to?(:size) will tell you if the foreign object has a size orlength.object.nil? will tell you if the foreign object represents the language’sequivalent of null or nil.object.respond_to?(:call) will tell you if a foreign object can be executed.object.respond_to?(:new) will tell you if a foreign object can be used tocreate a new object (if it’s a class).object.respond_to?(:keys) will tell you if a foreign object can give you alist of members.object.respond_to?(:class) will tell you if an object is a Java class.Polyglot.as_enumerable(object) will create a Ruby Enumerable from theforeign object, using its size or length and reading from it.Where boolean value is expected (e.g. in if conditions) the foreign value isconverted to boolean if possible or considered to be true.Accessing Java ObjectsTruffleRuby’s Java interop interface is similar to the interface from theNashorn JavaScript implementation, as also implemented by Graal.js.It is easier to use Java interop in JVM mode (--jvm).Java interop is also supported in native mode but requires more setup.See https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/embed/#build-native-images-from-polyglot-applications for details.Java.type(&#39;name&#39;) returns a Java class object, given a name such asjava.lang.Integer or int[]. With the class object, .new will create aninstance, .foo will call the static method foo, [:FOO] will read the fieldFOO, and so on. To access instance methods use .class, such asMyClass.class.getName.To import a Java class as a top-level constant, use Java.import &#39;name&#39;.Java.synchronized(object) { } will use the Java object’s monitor tosynchronize.Embedding in JavaTruffleRuby is embedded via the Polyglot API, which is part of GraalVM. You willneed to use the GraalVM to use this API.import org.graalvm.polyglot.*;class Embedding {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Context polyglot = Context.newBuilder().allowAllAccess(true).build();        Value array = polyglot.eval(&quot;ruby&quot;, &quot;[1,2,42,4]&quot;);        int result = array.getArrayElement(2).asInt();        System.out.println(result);    }}Using Ruby Objects from Embedding JavaRuby objects are represented by the Value class when embedded in Java.Accessing arraysboolean hasArrayElements()Value getArrayElement(long index)void setArrayElement(long index, Object value)boolean removeArrayElement(long index)long getArraySize()Accessing methods in objectsboolean hasMembers()boolean hasMember(String identifier)Value getMember(String identifier)Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; getMemberKeysvoid putMember(String identifier, Object valueboolean removeMember(String identifier)Executing procs, lambdas, and methodsboolean canExecute()Value execute(Object... arguments)void executeVoid(Object... arguments)Instantiating classesboolean canInstantiate() {Value newInstance(Object... arguments)Accessing primitivesboolean isString()String asString()boolean isBoolean()boolean asBoolean()boolean isNumber()boolean fitsInByte()byte asByte()boolean fitsInShort()short asShort()boolean fitsInInt()int asInt()boolean fitsInLong()long asLong()boolean fitsInDouble()double asDouble()boolean fitsInFloat()float asFloat()boolean isNull()The JRuby migration guide includes some more examples.StringsRuby strings and symbols are converted to Java strings when they are passed toforeign languages, and Java strings are converted to Ruby strings when theyare passed into Ruby.Threading and InteropRuby is designed to be a multi-threaded language and much of the ecosystemexpects threads to be available. This may be incompatible with other Trufflelanguages which do not support threading, so you can disable the creation ofmultiple threads with the option --single-threaded. This option is set bydefault unless the Ruby launcher is used, as part of the embedded configuration,described below.When this option is enabled, the timeout module will warn that the timeoutsare being ignored, and signal handlers will warn that a signal has been caughtbut will not run the handler, as both of these features would require startingnew threads.Embedded configurationWhen used outside of the Ruby launcher, such as from another language’s launchervia the polyglot interface, embedded using the native polyglot library, orembedded in a Java application via the Graal SDK, TruffleRuby will beautomatically configured to work more cooperatively within another application.This includes options such as not installing an interrupt signal handler, andusing the IO streams from the Graal SDK. It also turns on the single-threadedmode, as described above.It will also warn when you explicitly do things that may not work well whenembedded, such as installing your own signal handlers.This can be turned off even when embedded, with the embedded option(--ruby.embedded=false from another launcher, or-Dpolyglot.ruby.embedded=false from a normal Java application).It’s a separate option, but in an embedded configuration you may want to setallowNativeAccess(false) in your Context.Builder, or use the experimental--platform-native=false option, to disable use of the NFI for internalfunctionality.Also, the experimental option --cexts=false can disable C extensions.Note that, unlike for example pure JavaScript, Ruby is more than aself-contained expression language. It has a large core library that includeslow-level IO and system and native-memory routines which may interfere withother embedded contexts or the host system.",

GraalVM provides simple command line tools forruntime and memory profiling to help you analyze and optimize your code.In this section, we use an example application to demonstrate the profilingcapabilities that GraalVM offers. This example application uses a basic primenumber calculator based on the ancient Sieve of Eratosthenesalgorithm.      Copy the following code into a new file named primes.js:     class AcceptFilter {     accept(n) {         return true     } } class DivisibleByFilter {     constructor(number, next) {         this.number = number;         this.next = next;     }     accept(n) {         var filter = this;         while (filter != null) {             if (n % filter.number === 0) {                 return false;             }             filter = filter.next;         }         return true;     } } class Primes {     constructor() {         this.number = 2;         this.filter = new AcceptFilter();     }     next() {         while (!this.filter.accept(this.number)) {             this.number++;         }         this.filter = new DivisibleByFilter(this.number, this.filter);         return this.number;     } } var primes = new Primes(); var primesArray = []; for (let i = 0; i &amp;lt; 5000; i++) {     primesArray.push(primes.next()); } console.log(`Computed ${primesArray.length} prime numbers. ` +             `The last 5 are ${primesArray.slice(-5)}.`);        Run js primes.js.

This code takes a moment to compute so let’s see where all the time is spent.        Run js primes.js --cpusampler to enable CPU sampling.    The CPU sampler tool should print output for the example application as follows:     $ ./js primes.js --cpusampler Computed 5000 prime numbers.

Tracing histograms often provides insights into the behavior of the algorithm that needs optimization.    Lastly, using the memory tracer tool for capturing allocations is currently an experimental feature in GraalVM.

For each prime number that was computed, the program allocates one object in next and one in constructor of DivisibleByFilter. Allocations are recorded independently of whether they could get eliminated by the compiler. The Graal compiler is particularly powerful in optimizing allocations and can push allocations into infrequent branches to increase execution performance. The GraalVM team plans to add information about memory optimizations to the memory tracer in the future.  Tool ReferenceUse the --help:tools option in all guest language launchers to displayreference information for the CPU sampler, the CPU tracer, and the memory tracer.The current set of available options is as follows:CPU Sampler Command Options  --cpusampler: enables the CPU sampler.

We fixed an issue causing a delay when shutting down the virtual machine process at the end of the execution of an application(see #1140).Native ImageWe improved the structure of the org.graalvm.nativeimage API: classes that canonly be used during image generation are now in the packageorg.graalvm.nativeimage.hosted, to clearly separate them from the classes thatcan be used at image run time. In order to stay backwards compatible, theoriginal classes are still present, but marked as deprecated. They will bedeleted in the next release candidate, so please update to the new classes.We fixed several bugs that were reported on GitHub, including anissue with the logging framework which materialized as an error that no instances of java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter are allowed in the image heap.As a result, native images work now correctly with Helidon, a Javaframework designed for writing microservices which recently announced theirsupport for GraalVM native images:Helidon flies faster with GraalVM.RubyA complete changelog for the Ruby component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Rounding modes have been implemented or improved for Float, Rational, BigDecimal classes (see #1509).  Added a pure-Ruby implementation of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) which passes almost all Ruby FFI specs (see #1529).  The KeyError raised from ENV#fetch and Hash#fetch now matches MRI’s message formatting (see #1633).JavaScriptA complete changelog for the JavaScript component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Loading JavaScript source code from URLs is now guarded by thejs.load-from-url command line option and prohibited by default.RA complete changelog for the R component is available on GitHub. The highlights include:  Allow parsing any letter in identifiersincluding, e.g., Japanese, with lexer starting from 1.0-RC16, which matchesGNU-R behavior.Python  Improved startup time of the graalpython native launcher.LLVM Runtime  The lli launcher now starts with the locale set to C.1.0-RC15(2019-04-05)JavaBy default,libgraal is nowused when running the java launcher or when using the --jvm mode for thelanguage launchers. The libgraal library is a version of the GraalVM compilerpre-compiled by native-image. In addition to improving startup time, libgraalcompletely prevents the GraalVM compiler from interfering with the heap usage andprofiles of application code. It has execution properties similar to othernative HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2.JavaScript  Enabled Polyglot builtin based on Context.Builder.allowPolyglotAccess().  Added rest and spread properties support for foreign objects. For example, this spread syntax is now supported:    var arr1 = [0, 1, 2];var arr2 = [3, 4, 5];arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RNew Features  Implemented gzcon builtin for URL connections.Changes  Truffle interoperability API converts double values to int values if theyfit in the integer range. See the changes in the spectests.Bug Fixes  R incorrectly allowed Java interoperability when not started with --jvm.Starting from 1.0-RC15, --jvm flag is again necessary to enable interoperability with Java.A complete project changelog  is available on GitHub.RubyAn extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.Here is a short list of the most notable ones:Changes  Our experimental JRuby-compatible Java interop has been removed – use Polyglot and Java instead.  Process.clock_getres has been implemented.  debug, profile, profiler, which were already marked as unsupported, have been removed.Bug Fixes  autoload :C, &quot;path&quot;; require &quot;path&quot; now correctly triggers the autoload.  The shell standard library can now be require-d.Compatibility  Improved compatibility with MRI’s Float#to_s formatting #1626.  Added support for the base keyword argument to Dir.{[], glob}.PythonChanges  Migrated to the new Truffle libraries for interoperability support.  Added support for importing Java classes from the java namespace using normal Python import syntax, e.g., from java.util import ArrayList.  Implemented PEP 487 and PEP 560 to make the typing module work.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Interpreter  Added  a preliminary support for bitcode produced by LLVM 8.Native ImageBased on the feedback and bug reports, we improved the agent that traces reflectionand JNI usage on the JavaHotSpot VM. We also changed the implementation languageof the agent from C to Java. The agent is now a Native Image itself.The native-image-maven-plugin now supports multiline buildArgs andboolean parameter skip (skip image building if true).API changes for GraalVM integrators (SDK + Truffle)This version of GraalVM includes a major revision of the TruffleInteroperabilityAPIs.Most existing APIs for Truffle Interoperability were deprecated. Thecompatibility layer may cause significant performance reduction forinteroperability calls. Please see the Interop MigrationGuidefor an overview and individual @deprecated javadoc tags for guidance.We added Truffle Library API that allows language implementations to usepolymorphic dispatch for receiver types with support for implementation specificcaching/profiling with support for uncached dispatch. Please see the TruffleLibraryTutorialfor further details.The numerous changes were introduced to the GraalVM SDK Polyglot API as well:  Renamed Graal SDK to GraalVM SDK.  Experimental options now require --experimental-options on the command line tobe passed to the GraalVM language launchers, orContext.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions andEngine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to be set in other scenarios.For example, to diagnose the memory allocations of a JavaScript application with --memtracer profiling tool,you should prepend --experimental-options option:js --experimental-options --memtracer program.js.  Added a possibility to set an encoding in Source builder.  Added a new API for target type mappings using the new HostAccess API.We summarized all Truffle and SDK changes between GraalVM versions in separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsChrome Inspector  Object Preview feature added for GraalVM implementation of JavaScript.  Implemented a Custom Preview experimental feature for all languages supported by GraalVM.Ideal Graph Visualizer (IGV)Starting with 1.0-RC15 version of GraalVM, Ideal Graph Visualizer will beprovided as standalone download from Oracle Technology Network Downloads page. It is not part of GraalVM Community or Enterprise editions.1.0-RC14(2019-03-18)Introducing --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt;We introduced a uniform --vm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; which allows to pass options in a uniform way, without knowing which VM mode (--jvm, or --native) will be used. It replaces  --jvm.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; and --native.&amp;lt;option&amp;gt; command line options, e.g., the option to configure the maximum amount of memory used for the heap --jvm.Xmx=5G becomes --vm.Xmx=5G.This applies to all languages.JavalibgraalThis is the first release to include a prebuilt libgraal shared library. This shared library is produced by the native-image and contains a pre-compiled version of the GraalVM compiler. In addition to improving startup, libgraal completely avoids interfering with the heap usage and profiling of the application code. That is, it has execution properties similar to other native HotSpot compilers such as C1 and C2. To try it out, add -XX:+UseJVMCINativeLibrary to your java command line. Note that this is still a work in progress and we are focusing on improving its stability and ensuring it does not compromise peak performance.Default Failure BehaviorThe default behavior has changed for a failure (i.e., uncaught exception) duringthe compilation. These are now silently ignored and nothing is printed to theconsole. To get the old behavior of a message being printed to the console andfor collecting diagnostics about the failure, you now need to specify-Dgraal.CompilationFailureAction=Diagnose option.Native ImagesNew FeaturesWe introduced a tracing agent for the Java HotSpot VM that records usages of reflection and JNI that can then be converted to configuration files for the native image generator. This simplifies the process of getting new applications working as native images. For details, please look at the documentation.We improved support for the java.util.logging API. See the GitHub docs for details.The javax.script.ScriptEngine API is now supported. Please note that the Nashorn JavaScript engine does not work in native images and is therefore always excluded. However, Truffle based language implementations such as the GraalVM JavaScript engine are available when, e.g., the native image is built with the option --language:js.Implemented the Class.getSimpleName method for the native images (see 1020).Bugfixes      Fixed an NPE during native image generation at accessing annotations metadata on the classes opened for reflection (see 1048).        Fixed createTempFile() providing non-default filesystem and failing (see 1035).        Fixed a segfault due to incorrect socket address length value (see 1025).  JavaScriptHTML-like CommentsWe added support for HTML-like comments.var s = &quot;Introducing html-like comments&quot;;alert(s);&amp;lt;!-- this is a comment --&amp;gt;Changes  Renamed the option js.experimental-array-prototype to js.experimental-foreign-object-prototype.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RThe GraalVM implementation of R in this release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.Error PropagationAccording to the R semantics, errors are handled immediately at the point where they are raised. However, in language embedding or polyglot scenarios, it is more useful to have the errors propagate out of the R scope, so that they can be handled correctly. We changed the behavior of FastR in this regard so that now R errors are propagated. Note that this only happens if this is possible without causing unexpected side effect in R code,i.e., if there are no options(error = ...) or on.exit(...) handlers on the stack.Experimental OptionsAll specific options (NOT those GNU-R compatible like --save) are experimental except for --R.PrintErrorStacktracesToFile, which is an option that enables logging of FastR internal errors for bug reporting purposes. Experimental options can be unlocked using --experimental-options or with ContextBuilder#allowExperimentalOptions.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.RubyThis version of GraalVM features new methods implementations and other updates for Ruby implementation.New Features  Implemented Dir.children and Dir#children, String#delete_prefix, #delete_suffix and related methods.Changes  -Xlog= has been removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J flag has been removed. Use --vm.* instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and similar have been removed. You should use --vm.cp=lib.jar or --vm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  The -X option now works as in MRI.An extensive list of changes is available on GitHub.PythonPython 3.7.0The standard library was updated to Python 3.7.0 from 3.6.5.Changes  Defined a subset of the graalpython launcher options as “stable”. All other options are subject to change and need to be unlocked explicitly on the command line.  Added the support for  -I flag to ignore the user environment and not add the working directory to sys.path.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Various bug fixes.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)New Features  Added Context.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental options can be passed to a Context.  Added Engine.Builder#allowExperimentalOptions to control whether experimental instrument and engine options can be passed.  The @Option annotation can now specify the stability of an option.  Added engine bound TruffleLogger for instruments. The engine bound logger can be used by threads executing without any context.Changes  Multiple deprecated elements were removed from  the Truffle Language Implementation Framework, i.e., TruffleException.isTimeout, EventBinding.getFilter etc..We summarized GraalVM Truffle and GraalVM SDK changes between GraalVM versions in the separate changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC13(2019-03-05)ToolsIdeal Graph VisualizerWith GraalVM 1.0-RC13 release, there has been a significant change to theIdeal Graph Visualizer developer tool. The default behavior of the Dgraal.Dumpoption has changed in that IGV dumps are now written to the local file system by default.To get the old behavior of dumping straight to an IGV instance listening on 127.0.0.1:4445,you need to add -Dgraal.PrintGraph=Network option.If a network connection cannot be opened, dumping falls back to file system dumping.Graal VisualVMAnother developer tool, Graal VisualVM, now allows Heap monitoring of native-image processes.This functionality is available with GraalVM Enterprise Edition.R  R specific command line options are now passed as –R.PrintErrorStackTracesToFile=true instead of using JVM properties (–jvm.R:+PrintErrorStackTracesToFile). You can view available options with --help:languages.  Optional post installation script, configure_fastr, also regenerates etc/Renviron and etc/ldpaths files according to the target system.  R vectors are not writeable from other languages, because this would violate the R language semantics.A list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub.JavaScript  Node.js updated from 10.15.0 to version 10.15.2.  Made JavaScript and Java interoperability available in native images. Note that you have to configure the accessible classes and methods at native image build time (see reflection configuration).  Node.js Worker class should be used instead of deprecated experimental Java.Worker API now.  A deprecated NashornJavaInterop mode was removed.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  Added the support for embedded bitcode in Mach-O files. We support bitcode in the __bitcode section of Mach-O object files, as well as bitcode files in an embedded xar archive in the __bundle section of executables or dylibs. For example, on OS X, you can compile your code with clang -fembed-bitcode -flto hello.c -o hello, creating a native executable with embedded bitcode. You can then run it natively (./hello) or with GraalVM ($GRAALVM_HOME/bin/lli ./hello).The full project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis release of GraalVM is rich in performance and compatibility improvements,multiple changes and bug fixes for Ruby implementation.An extensive list of all updates is available on  Github.  Here is a short list of most notable ones:New features:  Host interoperability with Java now works on SubstrateVM too.Changes:  -Xoptions has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --help:languages instead.  -Xlog= has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --log.level= instead.  -J has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --jvm. instead.  -J-cp lib.jar and so on have been deprecated and will be removed. Use--jvm.cp=lib.jar or --jvm.classpath=lib.jar instead.  -J-cmd, --jvm.cmd, JAVA_HOME, JAVACMD, and JAVA_OPTS do not work in any releasedconfiguration of TruffleRuby, so have been removed.  -Xoption=value has been deprecated and will be removed. Use --option=value instead.  TracePoint.trace and TracePoint#inspect have been implemented.Compatibility:  Improved the exception when an -S file is not found.  Removed the message from exceptions raised by bare raise to better match MRI #1487.  TracePoint now handles the :class event.Note that GraalVM 1.0-RC13 implementation of Ruby is built on Ruby 2.4.4, and itis still vulnerable to CVE-2018-16395. This will be fixed in the next release.PythonNew feature:  Allow installation of NumPy in a venv. Just run e.g., bin/graalpython -m venv numpy_env; source numpy_env/bin/activate; graalpython -m ginstall install numpy. Note that not all NumPy features work at the moment.To see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added Debugger.getSessionCount() to return the number of active debugger sessions.  TruffleLanguage class now can register additional services. This change also deprecates the automatic registration of the language class as a service.  OptionCategory.DEBUG has been renamed to OptionCategory.INTERNAL for clarity.  Added static member to class objects that provides access to the class’s static members.  OptionStabilityhas been added for specifying the stability of an option.All GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC12(2019-02-04)Native Image GenerationNative images now check the remaining available stack size on every method call,and throw a StackOverflowError on stack overflows.We continued the work on the support of incomplete classpaths. There were no big changes,but only small bug fixes based on users feedback. The support for incomplete classpathsnow allows to run the native image generator with bytecode verification,i.e., the option --no-verify is no longer passed to the Java HotSpot VMwhen running the native image generator.RAn extensive list of changes to GraalVM implementation of R is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable ones:  FastR now uses the R base function print to implement TruffleLanguage#toString, so that tools and debuggers (like the Chrome Dev Tools console) format values (e.g., data.frame objects) in a familiar, R-like, way.  GraalVM implementation of R provides GNU-R compatible parseData for expressions parsed via parse(...,keep.source=T), which enables packages that use this functionality (like lambda.r and plumber) to work.  Added a dummy implementation of the ALTREP framework to avoid linking problems.JavaScript  Updated Node.js from 10.9.0 to version 10.15.0.  A new option js.experimental-array-prototype added to set prototype of array-like non-JS objects (like ProxyArray or Java List) to Array.prototype. It makes it possible to use functions like map or forEach on these objects directly.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM Runtime  In order to streamline the polyglot APIs in LLVM Runtime, we deprecated the truffle_* builtin functions. We also broke binary compatibility to bitcode compiled with polyglot.h from version 1.0.0-RC2 (or older).  Read-only globals are now placed in read-only memory. This was necessary to accommodate some changes in mac OS Mojave’s libc that raise errors when format strings are placed in the writable memory.The project changelog is available on GitHub.RubyThis version came with the compatibility improvements:  Change to a new system for handling Ruby objects in C extensions which greatly increases compatibility with MRI.  Support for BigDecimal#to_r was implemented (See #1521).A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.PythonTo see a complete list of changes, please refer to the project changelog.  Added support for the __class__ variable in the class scope.  Initial support of the venv standard-library tool, the built-in _bz2 module and the pandas package was started up.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added the ability to create native image heap dump directly from Graal VisualVM interface.  Improved heap dump support in the native image.1.0-RC11(2019-01-14)Native Image GenerationWe improved the handling of incomplete classpaths, i.e., code that references classes that are not provided on the classpath. The approach we took for RC10 caused problems in corner cases that would have been difficult to fix, therefore we implemented a different approach. Thanks to everyone who tried our initial approach and reported problems on GitHub. We attempted to verify that all reported problems are solved with the new approach.JavaScript  Graal.js only supports ECMAScript 5 (ES5) and newer, and enforces that rule.  Added support for sharing Java objects using the experimental Node.js Worker Threads API.  Added support for ScriptEngine GLOBAL_SCOPE bindings.  Added options to enable/disable several extension features e.g., print() or load().  Added options to disable features for security reasons e.g., eval().More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeGraalVM now reports source filenames and line numbers for LLVM functions in stack traces if the bitcode is compiled with debug information, even if the original source is not available.Find a complete changelog on GitHub.RubyA complete project changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes:  Allowed signal 0 to be used with Process.kill (see #1474).  Implemented Dir.each_child.  Added missing support for the close_others option to exec and spawn.  Implemented the missing MatchData#named_captures method (see #1512).  Process::CLOCK_ constants have been given the same value as in standard Ruby.  All core files now make use of frozen String literals, reducing the number of String allocations for core methods.PythonThe changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ginstall custom module to install known packages such as NumPy and setup tools using graalpython -m ginstall.  Added support for the yield from syntax.  Added more built-in methods to the time module.  Added support for the standard zipfile module.  Added the built-in _cvs module.  Various bug fixes and performance improvements.  Removed the exposure of internal languages through polyglot.eval.R  The R version was upgraded to R-3.5.1.  R does not print or log any details for internal errors unless it is run with  --jvm.DR:+PrintErrorStacktracesToFile.  Newly implemented R native API functions:  Rf_duplicated, Rf_setVar, norm_rand, exp_rand.  Numerous bug fixes.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Please refer to the project changelogs for a list of APIs changes:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Added CPU monitoring of native-image processes.  Improved the search feature in text views - thread dumps, OQL console results, etc..  Heap viewer is now displaying JVM arguments, has improved performance and memory management.1.0-RC10(2018-12-05)Bug fixes and performance improvements across all GraalVM components.Native Image GenerationAdded a new option --allow-incomplete-classpath with GraalVM 1.0-rc10. By default (without specifying this option), classes that are reachable, but missing on the class path, are reported at native image generation time. When specifying this new option, missing classes are only reported at run time. The option provides support for, e.g., libraries that probe the existence of classes, catch the class loading error, and then fall back to a different behavior. This should result in more applications being able to compile to a GraalVM native image.JavaScriptThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Added the ability to construct the Java classpath programmatically. If you know at runtime where the classes and jar files are located – you can add them to the classpath and use Java code from them.  Compatibility: added support for several proposals which might become parts of ECMAScript 2019: Array.prototype.{flat,flatMap}, well-formed JSON.stringify, globalThis.  Compatibility: moved several non-standard builtins behind flags (see the  changelog).LLVM Runtime  Improved the debugging experience: internal functions (originating from the GraalVM LLVM interpreter implementation) are now hidden in the stack traces by default and can be debugged with --inspect.Internal; and unhandled exceptions are now output to stderr instead of stdout.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc10 implementation of Ruby comes with several new features and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Compatibility: implemented the following API and added libraries:          The nkf and kconv standard libraries were added.      Queue and SizedQueue, #close and #closed?, have been implemented.      Kernel#clone(freeze) has been implemented.      Warning.warn has been implemented.      Thread.report_on_exception has been implemented.        Compatibility: ArgumentError messages now better match MRI.Python  Several users-facing improvements were made to the embedding interfaces: getting/setting the current working directory in Python now uses the appropriate Truffle APIs, Python will report side effects in the KEY_INFO message, and the KEYS message now responds with attributes and methods (not with dict keys).  The interactive help() builtin now works, including asking about language and syntax.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.RMade important steps for compatibility with the R ecosystem:  Improved the support for popular packages: Rcpp modules, dplyr now mostly works,and FastR provides its own version of data.table (work in progress).  A new builtin function install.fastr.packages(pkgs) can be used to install FastR-specific versions of the rJava and data.table packages.  Fixed linking problems on MacOS when installing R packages and using Fortran code.The full changelogis available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMSeveral quality of life improvements:  Added the display of system properties for SVM heap dumps.  Added support for the fields histogram and merged references for guest languages: JavaScript, Ruby, and so on.  Improved CPU Sampler accuracy.Ideal Graph Visualizer  The tool understands mx project structure now, e.g., the GraalVM compiler project when opening sources.  Improved performance when laying out large graphs.1.0-RC9(2018-11-05)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated based JDK to 8u192. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.RubyGraalVM 1.0-rc9 implementation of Ruby features security updates and multiple bug fixeswhich can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.  Here is a short list of most notable changes:  LLVM for Oracle Linux 7 can now be installed without building from source.  The supported version of LLVM for Oracle Linux has been updated from 3.8 to 4.0.  mysql2 is now patched to avoid a bug in passing NULL to rb_scan_args, and now passes the majority of its test suite.  The post-install script now automatically detects if recompiling the OpenSSL C extension is needed. The post-install script should always be run in TravisCI as well, see the documentation.  Detect when the system libssl is incompatible more accurately and add instructions on how to recompile the extension.Python  Added the support help in the builtin Python shell.  Added readline to enable history and autocompletion in the Python shell.  Add support for the -q, -E, -s, and -S Python launcher flags.  Improved support for string and bytes regular expressions using our TRegex engine.  Started the initial support for the binascii module.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.R  Various improvements in handling of foreign objects in R.  Added missing R builtins and C API: eapply builtin and rapply builtin.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.JavaScriptA complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added SourceElement.ROOT and StepConfig.suspendAnchors() to tune debugger stepping.  Added Context.Builder.logHandler and Engine.Builder.logHandler methods to install a logging handler writing into a given OutputStream.  Primitives, host and Proxy values can now be shared between multiple context and engine instances. They no longer throw an IllegalArgumentException when shared.The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Improved Python heapwalker by fixing class names and adding support for PString.  Fixed handling Page Up/Down in ProfilerTreeTable. See GH-109 for details.1.0-RC8(2018-10-19)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Added the support for Intel bit manipulation instructions. For more details, see #666.  Virtualize unsafe compare and swap calls on non-escaping objects. See #636.Maven Artifacts  The com.oracle.truffle group ID was renamed to org.graalvm.truffle.  The graal-sdk, launcher-common and polyglot-tck artifacts were moved from the org.graalvm group ID to org.graalvm.sdk.  New artifacts that are now available:          org.graalvm.compiler:compiler      org.graalvm.js:js      org.graalvm.js:js-launcher      org.graalvm.js:js-scriptengine      org.graalvm.regex:regex      org.graalvm.tools:chromeinspector      org.graalvm.tools:profiler      org.graalvm.truffle:truffle-nfi      com.oracle.substratevm:library-support      com.oracle.substratevm:objectfile      com.oracle.substratevm:pointsto      com.oracle.substratevm:svm-driver      com.oracle.substratevm:svm        The artifacts that are now modular JARs:          truffle-api      graal-sdk      js      js-scriptengine      compiler        The compiler artifact provides the jdk.internal.vm.compiler module and can be used to upgrade that module in JDK 11. Unlike the module present in the JDK, this version contains the optimizing Truffle runtime.Native Image Generation  The native image generator now has automatic support for services loaded using ServiceLoader.All service implementation classes, listed in the META-INF directory, are available automatically as soon as the service interface is used. This eliminates the need to manually register resources and reflection support for such classes. The automatic registration can be disabled with the -H:-UseServiceLoaderFeature option.  Finished the support for isolates (starting multiple independent VM instances at run time) and compressed references (to reduce memory footprint; Enterprise Edition only). More details are in an upcoming blog article.  A new Maven plugin allows native image generation from within a Maven build.  All components necessary for native image generation (Substrate VM and the GraalVM compiler) are now available on Maven Central. The dependency for that is:      &amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;com.oracle.substratevm&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;svm&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;1.0.0-rc8&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt;provided&amp;lt;/scope&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;  JavaScript  Updated Node.js to version 10.9.0.A complete changelog is available on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.Ruby  Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Fedora 28, and macOS 10.14 (Mojave) now supported.  Java.synchronized(object) { } and TruffleRuby.synchronized(object) { } methods have been added.  Added a TruffleRuby::AtomicReference class.  Performance of setting the last exception on a thread has now been improved.A complete project changelog is available on GitHub.Python  Python now supports the allocation profiler (--memtracer) to analyze the heap usage of applications.The changelog is available on GitHub.RGraalVM 1.0-rc8 implementation of R came up with multiple bug fixes which can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.ToolsGraal VisualVM  Introduced the CPU and Memory Sampler for guest languages.  Submitted improvements in the R language heapwalker.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)The major GraalVM SDK and Truffle changes between GraalVM versions are summarized in the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC7(2018-10-03)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Added the virtualization of Unsafe compare and swap calls, for more details see GH-636.Native Image Generation  Support for the Java security framework, see JCA-SECURITY-SERVICES.md for the details.  Support for https URL connections, see URL-PROTOCOLS.md for more details.JavaScript  Improved support for sharing of shapes between Contexts with the same Engine, which allows to reuse ASTs and objects across different manually created contexts.  Support for BigInteger typed TypedArrays.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  New polyglot builtin polyglot_has_member.  Removed support for implicit polyglot types for local variables as the availability of type information is not guaranteed. Explicit polyglot casts are now strictly required (polyglot_as_typed). See docs/INTEROP.md and polyglot.h for more details.  Support for IR-level (textual representation of bitcode files) tracing, i.e., creating an execution log of all bitcodes that were executed, for debugging purposes.  Preliminary support for LLVM 7.RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  Useful inspect strings have been added for more foreign objects.  Added the rbconfig/sizeof native extension for better MRI compatibility.  Support for pg 1.1. The extension now compiles successfully, but may still have issues with some datatypes.  readline can now be interrupted by the interrupt signal (Ctrl+C). This fixes Ctrl+C to work in IRB.  Fixed version check preventing TruffleRuby from working with Bundler 2.0 and later.  Removed obsoleted patches for Bundler compatibility now that Bundler 1.16.5 has built-in support for TruffleRuby.  Fixed problem with Kernel.public_send not tracking its caller properlyrb_thread_call_without_gvl() no longer holds the C-extensions lock.  Fixed caller_locations when called inside method_added.  Fixed mon_initialize when called inside initialize_copy.Python  Added support for the re.split builtin.  Enhanced the java interop builtin module with introspection utility methods.  Changes in C extension interface to reduce overhead.The changelogis available on GitHub.R  AWT based graphics devices (jpg, png, X11, …) is supported when running FastR as a native image.  eval.polyglot: the parameter source was renamed to code.  New builtin as.data.frame.polyglot.value creates R data frames from Polyglot objects (KEYS are used as column names, the values must be homogenous arrays, e.g., respond to HAS_SIZE).  Paths in eval.polyglot are resolved relative to the current working directory.  Various fixes necessary to pass dplyr tests (GitHub version of dplyr).More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.ToolsIdeal Graph Visualizer  User can navigate to Javascript (guest language) source from the graph nodes.  Ideal Graph Visualizer prompts to download plugins to support Javascript editing.  Simple scripts (written in Javascript) can be applied on graph data.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  GraalVM SDK and Truffle license changes from GPL2 with Class Path Exception to the Universal Permissive License (UPL). Please refer to the license files for more information: GraalVM Truffle license, GraalVM SDK license.To see the list of changes to the APIs, please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC6(2018-08-31)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  New optimization to remove unnecessary allocation in some calls to Enum.values().  See calls to Enum.values() don’t optimise away as expected for the details.Native Image Generation  Delay class initialization to runtime: By default, all classes that are seen asreachable for a native image are initialized during image building, i.e., theclass initialization method is executed during image building and is not seen asa reachable method at runtime. But for some classes, it is necessary to executethe class initialization method at runtime. This is now possible using the newoption --delay-class-initialization-to-runtime=&amp;lt;comma separate list of classnames&amp;gt; or using the new API RuntimeClassInitialization class.  Direct byte buffer are no longer allowed in the image heap: We added a new verification during image generation to ensure that no direct or mapped byte buffers (MappedByteBuffer instances) are in the image heap. Such buffers have either a pointer to C memory or reference a file descriptor, i.e., native resources that are available during image generation but no longer at image runtime. Using such a buffer would lead to a segfault at runtime. We discovered this issue because Netty has a few direct buffers that are created in class initializers. It is necessary to delay the initialization of such classes to runtime.  Better automatic discovery of classes, methods, and fields accessed via reflection. When String parameters of Class.forName, Class.getMethod, Class.getField, and other similar classes can be constant folded during image generation, then these classes, methods, and fields are automatically registered for reflection usage and do not need to be registered manually on the command line. Constant String parameters are a common pattern to support, e.g., different JDK versions or different library versions where a class, method, or field is not present in all cases and therefore cannot be used directly.LLVM RuntimeThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for LLVM IR-level debugging, i.e., debugging at the level of *.ll instead of *.c files.  New polyglot cast functions for primitive array types, which allows object from other languages to be used like primitive arrays.  Support for function pointer members in polyglot_as_typed, which allows objects from other languages to be used in expressions like obj-&amp;gt;func(args).RubyThe complete changelog is available on GitHub. Here is a short list of most notable changes.  TruffleRuby is now usable as a JSR 223 (javax.script) language;  A migration guide from JRuby is now included.  The embedded configuration -Xembedded can now be set set on the launcher command line.  Polyglot.export can now be used with primitives and converts strings to Java, when Polyglot.import converts them from Java.  Foreign objects optimisations such as unboxing foreign strings on to_s, to_str, and inspect.  Optimized performance and keyword rest arguments (def foo(**kwrest)).  Multiple bug fixes from user reports.PythonThe full changelog is available on GitHub.  Improved compatibility with regular expressions by including CPython’s sre module as a fallback engine (in addition to Truffle’s regular expression engine).  C extension modules can now be compiled with LLVM 5+, which was prevented by internal incompatibilities before.  Introduced lazy string concatenation to significantly speed up code patterns that repeatedly concatenated strings.  Numerous C-API improvements to extend support for scikit-learn.  Extensions and fixes in various areas: behavior of function and code objects, collections, exception handling during import, type ids, documentation and generators.  Update standard library to CPython 3.6.5.  Enable reuse of ASTs in multiple Contexts (requires the contexts to be created in the same polyglot Engine).RThe full changelogis available on GitHub.  Support for reading/writing graphical parameters via par.  Added numerous builtins to the C API, enabling support for packages like RCurl, rjson, compare, naivebayes, etc.  Added support for formulas that include ....  Various bug fixes: attributes of NULL objects, of CR/LF handling in readLine, La_chol with pivot, warnings/errors in vector coercion.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelog1.0-RC5(2018-07-31)GraalVM 1.0-rc5 is the first release where we provide pre-built binaries for GraalVM Community on macOS. As always all binaries are available from the downloads page.KNOWN ISSUES  The GraalVM Community distribution for macOS currently depends on some libraries that are not installed by default on current MacOS versions.This might cause issues with UI-related functionality:    Library not loaded: /usr/X11/lib/libfreetype.6.dylib    The necessary components can be added, e.g., by installing https://www.xquartz.org. We will remove this dependency in upcoming versions of GraalVM Community for macOS.  GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  1.0-RC5 includes JVMCI changes necessary to support compiling the GraalVM compiler ahead of time and deploying as a shared library alongside libjvm.so (i.e., libgraal). Note that the implementation of libgraal itself is not a part of this release as it is still under development.Native Image Generation  Added API that allows an application to distinguish between native image building, native image runtime, and regular Java execution. For more information and documentation, look at the class  ImageInfo.JavaScript  Removed legacy NashornExtensions option, use --js.nashorn-compat instead.  Added support for Symbol.prototype.description.  Added support for String.prototype.matchAll.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Simpler installation on macOS: it is no longer needed to add LLVM (/usr/local/opt/llvm@4/bin) to PATH on macOS.  --log.ruby.level= can be used to set the log level from any language launcher.  String#unpack1 has been implemented.  Optimized required and optional keyword arguments.  -Dtruffleruby.log and TRUFFLERUBY_LOG have been removed - use -Dpolyglot.log.ruby.level.  The custom log levels PERFORMANCE and PATCH have been removed.Python  Generator expressions now properly evaluate their first iterator in the definition scope at definition time.  Fixes for embedders to ensure top scopes are stable and local scopes always contain TruffleObjects.  C-API improvements to support simple Cython modules.  Support recognition of Python source files with the polyglot launcher, so that now --language python is not necessary when starting Python scripts with the polyglot launcher (note that the polyglot launcher still needs to be rebuilt using bin/gu rebuild-images polyglot after installing Python).Full changelog is available on GitHub CHANGELOG.md.RSee CHANGELOG for the list of changes.LLVM RuntimeThe project changelog is available on GitHub.  Support the __builtin_debugtrap function based on LLVM’s @llvmn.debugtrap intrinsic, which can be used to drop into the debugger (e.g., Chrome Inspector).  Support “zero-length array at end of struct” pattern when accessing polyglot values as structs.  Improved performance of global variable access.  Improved support for vectorized bitcode operations generated by clang.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added new execution listener API that allows for simple, efficient and fine-grained introspection of executed code.  Changed the default language context policy from SHARED to EXCLUSIVE, i.e. by default there is one exclusive language instance per polyglot or inner context. This can be configured by the language using the context policy.To see the full list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVM  Graal VisualVM was added to the GraalVM Community distribution.1.0-RC4(2018-07-13)General RemarksWhile we provide updated components for all languages for this rc4 release, only the JavaScript component received fixes from its upstream repository. All other languages are unchanged in terms of functionality.The next release, rc5, is planned for the beginning of August and will provide updates for all components.JavaScriptThe GraalVM JavaScript component has been updated to provide better compatibility with the Nashorn engine. There now is a --nashorn-compat flag to enable backwards compatibility functionality. This flag is highly discouraged for new applications, but can simplify the migration from Nashorn to GraalVM for existing code.  Access getters and setters like fields  Provide Java.extend, Java.super, JavaImporter, JSAdapter  Allow to construct Interfaces or AbstractClasses      Provide top-level package globals java, javafx, javax, com, org, edu    Provide Java.isScriptFunction, Java.isScriptObject, Java.isJavaMethod and Java.isJavaFunctionSome global functions and objects have been added for the scripting mode and can be enabled with the --scripting flag:  Provide $EXEC, $ENV, $ARG, $OPTIONS1.0-RC3(2018-06-29)GraalVM for Java Developers (GraalVM + compiler)  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_172” from “1.8.0_171”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Fixed a rare NullPointerException during JVMCI initialization.Native Image Generation  Added support for java.lang.reflect.Proxy supporting both automatic detection and manual configuration. Please refer to the documentation on GitHub for the details.  Added support for Classloader.getResource() and similar methods.  Added support for loading services through theServiceLoader.  Fixed a ClassCastException on generating native images for profile-guided-optimizations (with the --pgo-instrument command line option).JavaScript  Enabled code sharing between Contexts with the same Engine.  Added support for BigInt arithmetic expressions.  Added a flag for the Nashorn compatibility mode --js.nashorn-compat, for the details and migration from Nashorn please refer to the documentation.  Rename the flag for the V8 compatibility mode to js.v8-compat.More details can be found in the project changelog on GitHub.RubyThe full changelog is available in the GitHub repository, but here are some of the most notable changes.  Added ability to call is_a? on foreign objects.  Fixed: Qnil/Qtrue/Qfalse/Qundef can now be used as initial value for global variables in C extensions.  Fixed: SIGPIPE is correctly caught on SubstrateVM, and the corresponding write() raises Errno::EPIPE when the read end of a pipe or socket is closed.  Fixed determining the source encoding for eval() based on the magic encoding comment.Additionally, we implemented a number of performance improvements for stat() related calls, eval(), String substitutions, reading from IO and more.PythonGraalVM Python implementation is still in the early stages, but we’re making progress towards the goal of running applications which use SciPy.  Various C-API improvements allow to run simple NumPy examples.  Implemented buffered I/O and more encodings support, which enables working with files through the standard open function without having to force unbuffered access, and enables working with files that have encodings other than utf-8.  Most math module functions are now implemented and work correctly.  The random module substitute was removed and we now run the standard library random module to be fully compatible.  Improved thread-safety in the embedded scenarios when using Python contexts from multiple threads.More details are available in the project’s changelog on GitHub.R  Added more missing R builtins and C API functions, see CHANGELOG for a complete list.  Simplified installation, the script that configures FastR for the current system  jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr does not require Autotools anymore.  Added configuration files to allow users to build a native image of the FastR runtime, which reduces the startup time. Run jre/languages/R/bin/install_r_native_image to build the image.  Fixed an issue with the plotting window not displaying anything after it was closed and reopened.LLVM Runtime  New builtins polyglot_from_typed and polyglot_as_typed, which can be used to dynamically attach types to polyglot objects.  Implementers of TruffleObject can now respond to the GetDynamicType message to provide a type when an object is accessed from LLVM code.More details are available in the project changelog.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)  Added support for logging in Truffle languages and instruments.  Removed deprecated ResultVerifier.getDefaultResultVerifier API.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsGraal VisualVMWe improved memory footprint and introduced several UI improvements for cleaner more responsive experience of Graal VisualVM. In addition to that, there are the following improvements:  Added recognition of the LLVM Runtime processes.  Improved displaying logical values of guest languages’ objects.  Improved the Object Query Language (OQL) Console for inspecting memory dumps functionality — sorting, filtering, aggregation, unlimited number of results now work.Chrome inspector  Multiple inspector sessions for multiple polyglot engines can run on the same port now.1.0-RC2(2018-06-05)GraalVM for Java Developers  Updated the underlying JDK version to “1.8.0_171” from “1.8.0_161”. You can find the JDK release notes at the Oracle Technology Network website.  Improved support for the Java Microbenchmark harness. Since JMH 1.21, GraalVM is a recognized and supported JVM.  Fixed a StackOverflow exception an improved performance when recursively inlining of invokedynamic instructions.  Fixed a compiler error causing incorrect code generation while building the scalac compiler.Native Image Generation  Added support for building statically linked native images. Now you can pass --static, and if you have static libc and zlib installed, it generates a standalone executable that will not require libc for running.  Added Classpath exception to the license of SubstrateVM and the Graal compiler components to make sure all GraalVM code ending up in a native image is subject to this clause.  Fixed the handling of implicit exceptions (NullPointerExeption, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException, …): all exceptions now have correct stack traces and can be caught as expected. Previously, implicit exceptions were sometimes not caught by an exception handler within the same method.  Fixed a number of exceptions during the generation of native images that were reported by early adopters.JavaScript  Updated Node.js to 8.11.1 (from 8.9.4), it is not a breaking change, but it brings numerous improvements, including CVE-listed security fixes.LLVM Runtime  Added a new API for accessing Java types and instantiating foreign objects from LLVM languages.Now it is possible to easily call Java code from native programs compiled to the LLVM bitcode. The example below shows how you can access Java’s BigInteger long math operations from C.#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;polyglot.h&amp;gt;int main() {    void *bigInteger = polyglot_java_type(&quot;java.math.BigInteger&quot;);    void *(*BigInteger_valueOf)(long) = polyglot_get_member(bigInteger, &quot;valueOf&quot;);    void *bi = BigInteger_valueOf(2);    void *result = polyglot_invoke(bi, &quot;pow&quot;, 256);    char buffer[100];    polyglot_as_string(polyglot_invoke(result, &quot;toString&quot;),                       buffer,                       sizeof(buffer),                       &quot;ascii&quot;);    printf(&quot;%sn&quot;, buffer);}If we compile it to the LLVM bitcode, we can execute it with GraalVM. You can see that it computes the value of2^256 which isn’t that easy to do in C otherwise.# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ clang -c -O1 -emit-llvm -I$GRAALVM_HOME/jre/languages/llvm big-integer-demo.c# shelajev at shrimp.local in /tmp→ lli --jvm big-integer-demo.bc115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936A more detailed list of changes to the LLVM interpreter can be found in the full changelog.Ruby  We are now compatible with Ruby 2.4.4.  Java.import name imports Java classes as top-level constants.  Coercion of foreign numbers to Ruby numbers now works.  to_s works on all foreign objects and calls the Java toString.  to_str will try to UNBOX and then re-try to_str, in order to provoke the unboxing of foreign strings.Much more details can be found in the full changelog.RAmong the other changes, we improved the stability of GraalVM’s R implementation.  Added a /jre/languages/R/bin/configure_fastr script that allows FastR’s native build scripts to adopt to the current system, which makes installing R packages much more stable.  The fastr_errors.log file was renamed to fastr_errors_pidXYZ.log and is stored in either initial working directory, the user home directory, /tmp, or the FastR home directory (picking the first location that is writeable). Please add it to the bug reports if you submit issues.Python  Added support for the Python unittest framework.  Python now supports breaking on exceptions and unwinding to stack frames in Chrome inspector.API Changes for GraalVM Integrators (SDK + Truffle)Both GraalVM SDK and Truffle are offering API for developers trying to build things on top of GraalVM, language implementations, embedding GraalVM, and so on.  Enabled code sharing between guest language Contexts with the same Engine, speeding up the repeated evaluation of the code.To see the list of changes to the APIs please refer to the project changelogs:  GraalVM SDK changelog  GraalVM Truffle changelogToolsVisualVM  Fixed the issues with loading polyglot heap dumps  fixed executing of scripts in R console  improved recognition of R REPL  fixed loop to nodes  fixed memory leak in child nodes  improved appearance on MacOS  Applicability fixes  added roots histogram for classGraalVM Updater gu  The default operation mode changed from “install from local files” to “install from catalog”.  -c option for installing from the catalog, can be omitted (installing from the catalog the default), but specifying -c still works.

There are different components to GraalVM, so we highlightthe changes to these separately.Since GraalVM advances fast and has many different components, we believe we worked out an appropriate versioning scheme, described on the Version Roadmap page.In May 2020, GraalVM 20.1 was released as a production-ready software.Currently, there are two release branches of GraalVM: 19.3.x and 20.x. Duringthe year, there will be a few more releases from the main line of the project, e.g.,20.2, 20.3 to follow the updates to the platforms GraalVM dependsupon: OpenJDK, Node.js, LLVM, Ruby, R, Python. We grouped the release notes tomajor releases in a descending order for usability reasons.

                    "content": "Reporting Performance ProblemsWe are interested to hear from you if performance of TruffleRuby is lower thanother implementations of Ruby for code that you care about.Compatibility lists some features which we know are slow andare unlikely to get faster.TruffleRuby uses extremely sophisticated techniques to optimise your Rubyprogram. These optimisations take time to apply, so TruffleRuby is often a lotslower than other implementations until it has had time to ‘warm up’. Also,TruffleRuby tries to find a ‘stable state’ of your program and to automaticallyremove the dynamism of Ruby where it is not needed, but this then means that ifthe stable state is disturbed by something performance lowers again untilTruffleRuby can adapt to the new stable state. Another problem is thatTruffleRuby is very good at removing unnecessary work, such as calculations thatare not needed or loops that contain no work.All of these issues make it hard to benchmark TruffleRuby. This isn’t a problemthat is unique to us - it applies to many sophisticated virtual machines - butmost Ruby implementations are not yet doing optimisations powerful enough toshow them so it may be a new problem to some people in the Ruby community.Using the Enterprise Edition of GraalVMTo experiment with how fast TruffleRuby can be we recommend using theEnterprise Edition of GraalVM and rebuilding the Ruby executable images.Using the JVM ConfigurationFor the best peak performance, you want to use the JVM configuration, using--jvm. The default native configuration starts faster but doesn’t quite reachthe same peak performance. However, you must then use a good benchmarkingtool, like benchmark-ips described below, to run the benchmark, or the slowerwarmup time will mean that you don’t see TruffleRuby’s true performance in thebenchmark. If you want to write simpler benchmarks that just run a while loopwith a simple timer (which we would not recommend anyway), then use the defaultnative mode so that startup and warmup time is shorter.How to Check for Basic Performance ProblemsIf you are examining the performance of TruffleRuby, we would recommend that youalways run with the --engine.TraceCompilation flag. If you seecompilation failures or repeated compilation of the same methods, this is anindicator that something is not working as intended and you may need to examinewhy, or ask us to help you do so. If you don’t run with this flag Truffle willtry to work around errors and you will not see that there is a problem.How to Write a Performance BenchmarkWe recommend that you usebenchmark-ips, by Evan Phoenix, tocheck the performance of TruffleRuby, and it makes things easier for us if youreport any potential performance problems using a report from benchmark-ips.A benchmark could look like this:require &#39;benchmark/ips&#39;Benchmark.ips do |x|  x.iterations = 3  x.report(&quot;adding&quot;) do    14 + 2  endendWe use the x.iterations = extension in benchmark-ips to run the warmup andmeasurement cycles of benchmark-ips three times, because otherwise the firsttransition from warmup to measurement triggers one of those stable state upsetsdescribed above and will temporarily lower performance just as timing starts. Iwrote about this issue in more technicaldepth if you want to knowmore details.You’ll see something like this:Warming up --------------------------------------              adding    20.933k i/100ms              adding     1.764M i/100ms              adding     1.909M i/100msCalculating -------------------------------------              adding      2.037B (±12.7%) i/s -      9.590B in   4.965741s              adding      2.062B (±11.5%) i/s -     10.123B in   4.989398s              adding      2.072B (±10.5%) i/s -     10.176B in   4.975818sWe want to look at the last line, which says that TruffleRuby runs 2.072 billioniterations of this block per second, with a margin of error of ±10.5%.Compare that to an implementation like Rubinius:Warming up --------------------------------------              adding    71.697k i/100ms              adding    74.983k i/100ms              adding    75.195k i/100msCalculating -------------------------------------              adding      2.111M (±12.2%) i/s -     10.302M              adding      2.126M (±10.6%) i/s -     10.452M              adding      2.134M (± 9.2%) i/s -     10.527MSo we’d describe that as a thousand times faster than Rubinius. That seems likea lot - and what is actually happening here is that TruffleRuby is optimisingaway your benchmark. There’s not much we can do about that (a more technicaldiscussion of why follows), but it’s the best we can do. The effect is less withcomplex code that we cannot optimise away.More technical notesBlack holesSome other benchmarking tools for other languages have a feature called ‘blackholes’. These surround a value and make it appear to be variable at runtime evenif it’s in fact a constant, so that the optimiser does not remove it andactually performs any computations that use it. However, TruffleRuby usesextensive value profiling (caching of values and turning them into constants),and even if you make a value appear to be a variable at its source, it is likelyto be value profiled at an intermediate stage. In general we’d prefer morecomplex benchmarks that naturally defeat value profiling, rather than manuallyadding annotations to turn off important features.",

                    "title": "Security Guide",
                    "content": "Security GuideThis security guide provides developers and embedders with information on thesecurity model and features of GraalVM, such that they can build a secureapplication on top of it. It assumes that readers are familiar with the GraalVMarchitecture. This guide does not replace but rather supplements the Javasecurity documentation with aspects unique to GraalVM. It also provides securityresearchers with information on GraalVM’s security model.All security assumptions only apply to the enterprise version of GraalVM.This guide does not (yet) cover security aspects specific to a languageimplementation, usage of the Instrument API or any APIs other than the PolyglotAPI.Security ModelGraalVM is a shared runtime. It accepts instructions in a higher-levelprogramming language (or an intermediate representation thereof) as input, whichis executed at some point. Developers that implement security controls for theirapplications (such as access control) in code that is being run by GraalVM canrely on the correct execution of instructions. Incorrect execution ofsecurity-critical code running on top of GraalVM that allows to bypass such asecurity control is regarded a security vulnerability.Using the Truffle Language Implementation framework, interpreters for guestlanguages can be implemented to execute guest applications written in languagessuch as Javascript, Python, Ruby, R or WebAssembly (Wasm) on top of GraalVM. Theexecution context for these guest applications can be created with restrictedprivileges, to allow for the execution of less trusted guest applications. Forexample, an embedder writes an application server (the host application) thatruns JavaScript guest applications from a less trusted source. GraalVM offersfeatures to limit the privileges of the guest application to some extent.These restrictions are currently only supported in Javascript and managed LLVM.Ruby, R, Python, WASM are experimental and not recommended for production use at this time.For every guest language shipped with GraalVM, a launcher, e.g., interactiveshell, is provided. These launchers behave in the same way and come with thesame security guarantees as their “original” counterparts.We appreciate reports of bugs that break the security model via the processoutlined in the Reporting Vulnerabilities guide.Guest Application ContextGraalVM allows a host application written in a JVM-based language to create anexecution context to run code written in one or multiple guest language(s). Whencreating a context, the host application can control which resources the guestcan access. By default access to all managed resources is denied and needs to begranted explicitly.File I/OAccess to files can be controlled via two means. The allowIO privilege grantsthe guest application unrestricted access to the host file system:Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowIO(true).build();Alternatively the Truffle framework virtual file system that all guest file I/O will be routed through can be installed:Context context = Context.newBuilder().fileSystem(FileSystem fs).build();ThreadingA guest application can only create new threads, if the context is created with the corresponding privilege:Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowCreateThread(true).build()Native AccessThe Truffle framework native interface allows access to privileged native code.It needs to be granted to a guest application context via:Context context = Context.newBuilder().allowNativeAccess(true).build()Host InteroperabilityGraalVM allows exchanging objects between the host and the guestapplication. Since the guest application is potentially less trusted than thehost application, multiple controls exist to tune the degree of interoperabilitybetween the guest and the host:  allowHostAccess(policy) – configures which public constructors, methods or fields of public classes of the host can be accessed by the guest  allowHostClassLookup(Predicate&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; classFilter) – allows the guest application to look up the host application classes specified in the classFilter via Java.type. For example, a Javascript context can create a Java ArrayList, provided that ArrayList is whitelisted by the classFilter and access is permitted by the host access policy: context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;var array = Java.type(&#39;java.util.ArrayList&#39;)&quot;)  allowHostClassLoading(true/false) - allows the guest application to access the host’s class loader to load new classes. Classes are only accessible if access to them is granted by the host access policy.The host access policy has three different options:  ALL - all public constructors, methods or fields of public classes of the host can be accessed by the guest. Note that this exposes all host functionality to the guest, effectively disabling any security boundary between host and guest.  NONE - no constructors, methods or fields of the host can be accessed by the guest.  EXPLICIT - only public constructors, methods and fields of public classes that are annotated with @HostAccess.Export can be accessed by the guest.The following example demonstrates how these configuration options work together: public class MyClass {     @HostAccess.Export     public int accessibleMethod() {         return 42;     }     public static void main(String[] args) {         try (Context context = Context.newBuilder() //                         .allowHostClassLookup(c -&amp;gt; c.equals(&quot;myPackage.MyClass&quot;)) //                         .build()) {             int result = context.eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;&quot; +                             &quot;var MyClass = Java.type(&#39;myPackage.MyClass&#39;);&quot; +                             &quot;new MyClass().accessibleMethod()&quot;).asInt();             assert result == 42;         }     } }This Java/JavaScript example  creates a new context with the permission to look up the class myPackage.MyClass in the guest applicationevaluates a JavaScript code snippet that accesses the Java class myPackage.MyClass using the Java.type builtin provided by the JavaScript language implementation  creates a new instance of the Java class MyClass by using the JavaScript new keyword  calls the method accessibleMethod() which returns “42”. The method is accessible to the guest language because because the enclosing class and the declared method are public, as well as annotated with the @HostAccess.Export annotation.The guest can also pass objects back to the host. This is implemented by functions that return a value. For example,Value a = Context.create().eval(&quot;js&quot;, &quot;21 + 21&quot;);returns a guest object representing the value “42”. When executing less trustedguest code, application developers need to take care when processing objectsreturned from the guest application – the host application should treat them asless trusted input and sanitize accordingly.Managed Execution of LLVM IRThe Truffle framework also supports the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) asa guest language. Several native system programming languages, above all C/C++,can be compiled to LLVM IR with the LLVM compiler toolchain. Typically, theselanguages are not memory safe by themselves and violations of memory safetybeing a frequent cause for security vulnerabilities.The GraalVM Enterprise Edition adds support for a managed execution mode for LLVM IRcode. In managed mode, all ties to the native level are abstracted and routedthrough GraalVM. In particular this means that:  Temporal and spatial memory safety. Memory is allocated from the Java heap. Thismeans that memory allocations are managed objects and all accesses are performedin a memory-safe manner (no arbitrary pointer arithmetics, no uncheckedout-of-bounds accesses).  Type safety. It is not possible to reinterpret a data pointer into a functionpointer and execute arbitrary instructions (since these are distinct pointertypes for LLVM Runtime).  System calls are intercepted and routed to the corresponding Truffle frameworkAPIs. For example, file IO is mapped to the Truffle framework FileSystem API.The set of currently supported system calls is very limited – only syscallsthat can safely be mapped to the Truffle API level are available. Since LLVMruntime in managed mode always runs bitcode compiled for Linux/x86, it onlyneeds to implement system calls for this platform.  All dependent libraries are executed in managed mode as well, removing allreferences to natively executed system libraries. This includes libraries thatare provided by the LLVM Runtime, such as muslibc.Managed mode can be selected when creating a context (Context.create()) orwhen calling the bin/lli binary by specifying the --llvm.managed option. A“managed” context will adhere to any restrictions (e.g., allowIO) passedduring context creation and does not need the allowNativeAccess privilege.Security CaveatsNative Image HeapThe native image builder executes the static initializers of classes at buildtime and persists the state in the native image heap. This means that anyinformation that is obtained in static initializers becomes part of the nativeimage executable. This can lead to unintentionally including properties of thebuild environment, such as environment variables in the image heap.Developers can request static initializers to be re-run at runtime by eitherspecifying the --initialize-at-run-time CLI parameter when building a nativeimage, or making use of the RuntimeClassInitialization API.Sharing Execution EnginesApplication developers may choose to share execution engines among executioncontexts for performance reasons. While the context holds the state of theexecuted code, the engine holds the code itself. Sharing of an execution engineamong multiple contexts needs to be set up explicitly and can increaseperformance in scenarios where a number of contexts execute the same code. Inscenarios where contexts that share an execution engine for common code alsoexecute sensitive (i.e., private) code, the corresponding source objects can optout from code sharing with:Source.newBuilder(…).cached(false).build()ScriptEngine CompatibilityFor reasons of backward compatibility, certain guest languages also supportJava’s ScriptEngine interface. For example, this allows GraalVM JavaScript to beused as a drop-in replacement for Nashorn. However, to maintain compatibility,the Nashorn GraalVM JavaScript ScriptEngine interface will create a context withall privileges granted to the script and should be used with extreme caution andonly for trusted code.Security Manager and Untrusted CodeThe OpenJDK vulnerability group strongly discourages to running untrusted codeunder a security manager. This also applies to GraalVM, which does not supportuntrusted code execution in Java – GraalVM Native Image does not support asecurity manager in general. While GraalVM’s ability to restrict the executionof guest languages (languages implemented with Truffle framework) applicationsto a certain extent is not dependent on a security manager, it is also notsuited to be used as a sandbox for running untrusted code.If untrusted and potentially malicious code is to be executed, we recommendGraalVM customers who have an immediate requirement to execute untrusted andpotentially adversarial code, adopt the appropriate isolation primitives toensure the confidentiality and integrity of their application data.GraalVM Enterprise to GraalVM Community DowngradeGraalVM’s managed execution of native code is only available in GraalVMEnterprise. When downgrading to GraalVM Community, native code execution is onlyavailable with the allowNativeAccess privilege. This also applies to languagesimplemented with Truffle framework that allow for native code extensions, suchas Python and Ruby.",

TruffleRuby will report forexample:truffleruby ..., like ruby ..., GraalVM CE Native [x86_64-darwin]In Ruby code, you can look at the standard RUBY_ENGINE constant, which will be&#39;truffleruby&#39;. In C code TRUFFLERUBY is defined.It is also possible to use feature-detection instead of looking atRUBY_ENGINE.TruffleRuby is an integral part of GraalVM, so the version number of TruffleRubyis always the same as the version of GraalVM that contains it. If you are usingTruffleRuby outside of GraalVM, such as a standard JVM, the version will be&#39;0.0&#39;. You can find the version number of GraalVM and TruffleRuby using thestandard RUBY_ENGINE_VERSION constant.TruffleRuby Methods and ClassesTruffleRuby provides these non-standard methods and classes that provideadditional functionality in the TruffleRuby module.TruffleRuby.jit? reports if the GraalVM Compiler is available and will beused.TruffleRuby.native? reports if TruffleRuby is compiled as a native image.TruffleRuby.cexts? reports if TruffleRuby has the GraalVM LLVM Runtime for Cextensions available.TruffleRuby.revision reports the source control revision used to buildTruffleRuby.TruffleRuby.full_memory_barrier ensures lack of reordering of loads or storesbefore the barrier with loads or stores after the barrier.TruffleRuby.synchronized(object) { } will run the block while holding animplicit lock per object instance.Atomic referencesatomic_reference = TruffleRuby::AtomicReference.new(value=nil) creates a newatomic reference with a reference to a given object.atomic_reference.get gets the value of an atomic reference, returning thevalue.atomic_reference.set(new_value) sets the value of an atomic reference andcauses a memory barrier on writes involving new_value.atomic_reference.get_and_set(new_value) sets the value of an atomic reference,returns the previous value, and causes a memory barrier on writes involvingnew_value.atomic_reference.compare_and_set(expected_value, new_value) sets the valueof an atomic reference, only if it currently has the expected value, returninga boolean to say whether or not it was set, and causes a memory barrier onwrites involving new_value. For numeric objects it will get the currentvalue and then check that the current value is also a numeric and that it isequal to the expected value by calling ==, then perform an atomic compareand set.AtomicReference is marshalable.FFITruffleRuby includes a built-in implementation of Ruby-FFI,compatible with version 1.12.2 of the ffi gem. This should be transparent: you canjust install the ffi gem as normal, and it will use our built-in implementation,regardless of the version of the ffi gem.Polyglot ProgrammingThe Polyglot and Java modules provides access to the polyglot programmingfunctionality of GraalVM. They aredescribed in a separate document.Unsupported Additional FunctionalityYou may be able to find some other modules and methods not listed here that lookinteresting, such as Truffle::POSIX or Truffle::FFI. Additional modules andmethods not listed in this document are designed to support the implementationof TruffleRuby and should not be used. They may be modified or made not visibleto user programs in the future, and you should not use them.Extra macros, functions, and variables in TruffleRuby C extension headersbeyond those provided by MRI, such as those starting with rb_tr_*, areunsupported and should not be used by any C extension.",

These languages and features arecurrently available:  Java: Heap Summary, Objects View, Threads View, OQL Console  JavaScript: Heap Summary, Objects View, Thread View  Python: Heap Summary, Objects View  Ruby: Heap Summary, Objects View, Threads View  R: Heap Summary, Objects ViewStarting VisualVMTo start VisualVM execute jvisualvm. Immediately after the startup,the tool shows all locally running Java processes in the Applications area,including the VisualVM process itself.            Important: [GraalVM Native Image]({{ “/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/”      relative_url }}) does not implement JVMTI agent, hence triggering heap dump creation from Applications area is impossible. Apply -H:+AllowVMInspection flag with the native-image tool for Native Image processes. This way your application will handle signals and get a heap dump when it receives SIGUSR1 signal. Guest language REPL process must be started also with the --jvm flag to monitor it using VisualVM. This functionality is available with GraalVM Enterprise Edition. It is not available in GraalVM open source version available on GitHub. See the [Generating Native Heap Dumps]({{ “/docs/reference-manual/native_heapdump/”      relative_url }}) page for details on creating heap dumps from a native image process.      Getting Heap DumpTo get a heap dump of, for example, a Ruby application for later analysis,first start your application, and let it run for a few seconds to warm up. Thenright-click its process in VisualVM and invoke the Heap Dump action. Anew heap viewer for the Ruby process opens.Analyzing ObjectsInitially the Summary view for the Java heap is displayed. To analyze the Rubyheap, click the leftmost (Summary) dropdown in the heap viewer toolbar, choosethe Ruby Heap scope and select the Objects view. Now the heap viewer displaysall Ruby heap objects, aggregated by their type.Expand the Proc node in the results view to see a list of objects of this type.Each object displays its logical value as provided by the underlyingimplementation. Expand the objects to access their variables and references,where available.Now enable the Preview, Variables and References details by clicking the buttonsin the toolbar and select the individual ProcType objects. Where available, thePreview view shows the corresponding source fragment, the Variables view showsvariables of the object and References view shows objects referring to theselected object.Last, use the Presets dropdown in the heap viewer toolbar to switch the viewfrom All Objects to Dominators or GC Roots. To display the heap dominators,retained sizes must be computed first, which can take a few minutes for theserver.rb example. Select the Objects aggregation in the toolbar to view theindividual dominators or GC roots.Analyzing ThreadsClick the leftmost dropdown in the heap viewer toolbar and select the Threadsview for the Ruby heap. The heap viewer now displays the Ruby thread stacktrace, including local objects. The stack trace can alternatively be displayedtextually by clicking the HTML toolbar button.Reading JFR SnapshotsVisualVM tool bundled with GraalVM 19.2.x and later in both Community and Enterpriseeditions has the ability to read JFR snapshots – snapshots taken with JDKFlight Recorder (previously Java Flight Recorder). JFR is a tool for collectingdiagnostic and profiling data about a running Java application. It is integratedinto the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and causes almost no performance overhead,so it can be used even in heavily loaded production environments.To install the JFR support, released as a plugin:  run &amp;lt;GRAALVM_HOME&amp;gt;/bin/jvisualvm to start VisualVM;  navigate to Tools &amp;gt; Plugins &amp;gt; Available Plugins to list all available plugins and install the VisualVM-JFR andVisualVM-JFR-Generic modules.The JFR snapshots can be opened using either the File &amp;gt; Load action or bydouble-clicking the JFR Snapshots node and adding the snapshot into the JFRrepository permanently. Please follow the documentation for your Java version tocreate JFR snapshots.The JFR viewer reads all JFR snapshots created from Java 7 and newer and presents the data in typicalVisualVM views familiar to the tool users.These views and functionality are currently available:  Overview tab displays the basic information about the recorded process likeits main class, arguments, JVM version and configuration, and system properties.This tab also provides access to the recorded thread dumps.  Monitor tab shows the process uptime and basic telemetry – CPU usage, Heapand Metaspace utilization, number of loaded classes and number of live &amp;amp; startedthreads.  Threads tab reconstructs the threads timeline based on all events recorded inthe snapshot as precisely as possible, based on the recording configuration.  Locks tab allows to analyze threads synchronization.  File IO tab presents information on read and write events to the filesystem.  Socket IO tab presents information on read and write events to the network.  Sampler tab shows per-thread CPU utilization and memory allocations, and aheap histogram. There is also an experimental feature “CPU sampler” building CPUsnapshot from the recorded events. It does not provide an exact performanceanalysis but still helps to understand what was going on in the recordedapplication and where the CPU bottleneck might be.  Browser tab provides a generic browser of all events recorded in the snapshot.  Environment tab gives an overview of the recording machine setup and conditionlike CPU model, memory size, operating system version, CPU utilization, memoryusage, etc..  Recording tab lists the recording settings and basic snapshot telemetry likenumber of events, total recording time, etc..Note: The support of JDK Flight Recorder is currently experimental. Some advanced features likeanalyzing JVM internals, showing event stack traces or support for creating JFRsnapshots from live processes are not available in this preview version and willbe addressed incrementally in the following releases.",

This allows a simple registration of GraalVM as a runtime, code editingand debugging of polyglot applications.The following extensions are available from VSCode Marketplace:  GraalVM – a VS Code extension providing the basic environment for editing and debugging programs running on GraalVM and includes JavaScript and Node.js support by default.  GraalVM R – a VS Code extension providing the basic support for editing and debugging R programs running on GraalVM.  Graalvm Ruby – a VS Code extension providing the basic support for editing and debugging Ruby programs on GraalVM.  GraalVM Python – a VS Code extension providing the basic support for editing and debugging Python programs running on GraalVM.  GraalVM Extensions Pack – pack of all above listed extensions for simpler installation.Install ExtensionsGraalVM VSCode extensions can be simply installed from VSCode IDE Extensions panel by searching for GraalVMGraalVM ExtensionUpon the graalvm extension installation, launch VS Code bydouble-clicking on the icon in the launchpad or by typing code . from the CLI.The user is then requested to provide a path to the GraalVM home directory.For that purpose, next options can be used (invoke by Ctrl+Shift+P hot keys combination):  Select GraalVM Installation - Provides the UI to select an already installed GraalVM. By default, the following locations are searched for the already installed GraalVM:          the extension’s global storage      /opt folder as the default RPM install location      PATH environment variable content      GRAALVM_HOME environment variable content      JAVA_HOME environment variable content        Install GraalVM - Downloads the latest GraalVM release from Github and installs it within the extension’s global storage.  Install GraalVM Component - Downloads and installs one of the GraalVM’s optional components.To verify whether the PATH environment variable is valid, navigate to Code -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; Extensions -&amp;gt; GraalVM -&amp;gt; Home:If the path to GraalVM home directory is provided properly, the following debugconfigurations can be used:  Attach - Attaches debugger to a locally running GraalVM.  Attach to Remote - Attaches debugger to the debug port of a remote GraalVM.  Launch JavaScript - Launches  JavaScript using GraalVM in a debug mode.  Launch Node.js Application - Launches a Node.js network application using GraalVM in a debug mode.Languages interoperability is one of the defining features of GraalVM, enabledwith Polyglot APIs. The code completioninvoked inside JavaScript sources provides items for Polyglot.eval(...),Polyglot.evalFile(...) and Java.type(...) calls.For JavaScript sources opened in the editor, all the Polyglot.eval(...) callsare detected and the respective embedded languages are injected to theirlocations. For example, having an R code snippet called via the Polyglot APIfrom inside the JavaScript source, the R language code is embedded inside thecorresponding JavaScript string and all VS Code’s editing features (syntaxhighlighting, bracket matching, auto closing pairs, code completion, etc.) treatthe content of the string as the R source code.R ExtensionUpon the extension installation in VS Code, GraalVM is checked forpresence of the R component and a user is provided with an option of an automaticinstallation of the missing component. The Ctrl+Shift+P command from theCommand Palette can be also used to invoke Install GraalVMComponent option to install the R component manually.Once GraalVM contains the R component, the following debug configurationscan be used to debug your R scripts running on GraalVM:  Launch R Script - Launches an R script using GraalVM in a debug mode.  Launch R Terminal - Launches an integrated R terminal running on GraalVM in a debug mode.Thanks to languages interoperability within GraalVM, the code completion invokedinside R sources provides items for eval.polyglot(...) and new(&quot;&amp;lt;Java type&amp;gt;&quot;,...) calls. For R sources opened in editor, all the eval.polyglot(...) calls are detected and the respective embedded languages are injected to their locations.Please note, this R extension depends on the basic support for R language and GraalVM extension in VS Code.Ruby ExtensionSimilar to the above R extension installation, GraalVM is checked forpresence of the Ruby component and a user is provided with an option of an automaticinstallation of the missing component. The Ctrl+Shift+P command from theCommand Palette can be also used to invoke Install GraalVMComponent option to install the Ruby component manually.Once GraalVM contains the Ruby component, Launch Ruby Script debugconfiguration can be used to run your Ruby script in a debug mode.The code completion invoked inside Ruby sources provides items for Polyglot.eval(...), Polyglot.eval_file(...) and Java.type(...) calls. As with other languages, all the Polyglot.eval(...) calls are detected and the respective embedded languages are injected to their locations. For example, the JavaScript language code is embedded inside the corresponding Ruby string and all VS Code’s editing features (syntax highlighting, bracket matching, auto closing pairs, code completion, etc.) treat the content of the string as the JavaScript source code.This Ruby extension requires a default Ruby language support and GraalVM extension in VS Code.Python ExtensionGraalVM is checked for presence of the Python component and a user is providedwith an option of an automatic installation of the missing component, similar tothe previous R and Ruby extensions. The Ctrl+Shift+P command from the CommandPalette can be also used to invoke Install GraalVM Component option toinstall the Ruby component manually.Once GraalVM contains the Ruby component, Launch Python Script debugconfiguration can be used to run the Python script in a debug mode.Python VS Code extension requires a default Python language support and GraalVM extension in VS Code.",

                  "docs-why-graal":  {
                    "title": "Why GraalVM",
                    "content": "GraalVM offers a comprehensive ecosystem supporting a large set of languages (Java and other JVM-based languages, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, R, WebAssembly, C/C++ and other LLVM-based languages) and running them in different deployment scenarios (OpenJDK, Node.js, Oracle Database, or standalone). This page provides an overview of different scenarios in which GraalVM can make a difference for your applications.Some of versatile GraalVM capabilities, that might be missing on this page are thoroughly summarized and disclosed in Top 10 Things To Do With GraalVM blog post.For Java ProgramsFor existing Java applications, GraalVM can provide benefits by running them faster, providing extensibility via scripting languages, or creating ahead-of-time compiled native images.Run Java FasterGraalVM can run in the context of OpenJDK to make Java applications run faster with a new just-in-time compilation technology. GraalVM takes over the compilation of Java bytecode to machine code. In particular for other JVM-based languages such as Scala, this configuration can achieve benefits, as for example experienced by Twitter running GraalVM in production.            The compiler of GraalVM provides performance advantages for highly abstracted programs due to its ability to remove costly object allocations in many scenarios. You can find details in this research paper and try [an example]({{ “/docs/examples/java-performance-examples”      relative_url }}). Better inlining and more aggressive speculative optimizations can lead to additional benefits for complex long-running applications, see a [Stream API example]({{“/docs/examples/java-simple-stream-benchmark/”      relative_url }}).      Whether and how much of a difference GraalVM makes in terms of performance depends of course on the concrete workload. We are interested in receiving any kind of benchmarking results that can help us make GraalVM even faster.Make Your Application Extensible            GraalVM enables running JavaScript, R, Python, Ruby, LLVM IR and Web Assembly in the context of Java applications. It offers the ability to expose Java data structures to those languages with fine-grained host access filters. The integration is language-agnostic, i.e., an integration for JavaScript can at the later point be also used to execute any other GraalVM-based language. Proxy mechanisms allow mocking up dynamic objects from Java data structures and expose them to the embedded scripts. Take a look at [the description]({{“/docs/graalvm-as-a-platform/embed/”      relative_url }}) on how to make your JVM-based application extensible with GraalVM.      Create a Native Image            Running your application inside a Java VM comes with startup and footprint costs. GraalVM has a feature to create native images for existing JVM-based applications. The image generation process employs static analysis to find any code reachable from the main Java method and then performs full ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. The resulting native binary contains the whole program in machine code form for its immediate execution. It can be linked with other native programs and can optionally include the GraalVM compiler for complementary just-in-time (JIT) compilation support to run any GraalVM-based language with high performance. For additional performance, native images can be built with profile guided optimizations gathered in a previous run of the application. See an example of how to build native images [here]({{“/docs/reference-manual/aot-compilation/”      relative_url }}).      For Node.js ProgramsGraalVM can run in the context of Node.js by replacing V8 with GraalVM for executing JavaScript. The main benefits of doing so is to enable polyglot applications (e.g., use Java, R, or Python libraries), run Node.js with large heap configurations and Java’s garbage collectors, or use GraalVM’s interoperability to define data structures in C/C++ and use them from JavaScript.Reuse Libraries from Java, R, or Python            GraalVM enables the use of existing Java libraries or Java frameworks (like Spark or Flink) directly from Node.js. Also, one can use for example R or Python for data science or plotting directly from a JavaScript application. Find an example of a polyglot application [here]({{“/docs/examples/polyglot-javascript-java-r/”      relative_url }}).      Run with Large HeapsThe V8 JavaScript engine included in the standard Node.js distribution is tuned for browser configurations and designed to work effectively in small heap scenarios. We enable running Node.js with the heap management of the JVM, opening the ability for large heap configurations and suitable garbage collection settings. The maximum configurable heap size is 32 Gb with compressed 32-bit pointers, and terabytes of heap are supported in the 64-bit pointer configuration.Define Data Structures in C/C++            GraalVM allows efficient combination of native code (e.g., written in C/C++) and JavaScript. Native data structures can be directly accessed and the compiler can inline across any boundary. This can be beneficial in a scenario where efficient data structures are managed and allocated in C while other parts of the application are written in Node.js. Find an example of such scenario in the [reference manual]({{ “/docs/reference-manual/languages/llvm/#interoperability”      relative_url }} ).      For Ruby, R, Python or WebAssemblyRuby, R, Python, WebAssembly are experimental in the GraalVM ecosystem and not recommended for production use at this time, but we are actively working on stability and support for all modules for those languages. At this point in time, we can run simpler applications of Ruby, R, and Python but we do not have the same full compatibility we provide for Java and Node.js applications.WebAssembly currently implements the WebAssembly MVP (Minimum Viable Product) specification and is the youngest language in the GraalVM environment.Apart from the standard GraalVM benefits such as language interoperability (e.g., use Java or JavaScript from those applications), GraalVM can achieve high speedups of 10x or more for those languages. We are happy to assist with making existing Ruby and R applications work with GraalVM, but we cannot guarantee out-of-the-box compatibility for these languages yet.Running in Oracle DatabaseGraalVM is designed for embeddability and can be executed in databases. Ourprototype of the Oracle Database Multilingual Engine (MLE) is availablehere. It allows Oracle Database usersto run JavaScript, using browserify to execute Node.js modules, and to writeextensions in Python.For Microservices FrameworksGraalVM Native Image, currently available as an Early Adopter technology, works with many different Java microservices frameworks.Several projects have already accepted this technology as a platform for theirapplications: Quarkus, Micronaut, Helidon. For these frameworks GraalVM nativeimages significantly reduce the runtime memory requirements compared to runningon HotSpot. We believe that GraalVM Native Image technology can become the bestway for deploying cloud native applications.            ![microservices]({{ “/resources/img/ms_memory_footprint.png”      relative_url }})                  ![microservices]({{ “/resources/img/ms_startup_time.png”      relative_url }})      For Your PlatformWe encourage the development of GraalVM embeddings similar to our ownintegrations in the Oracle Database, OpenJDK, or Node.js. Together with researchcollaboration partners, we already explored ideas of embedding in Spark orFlink. Find a description on how to embed GraalVM in your existing JVM-basedapplication or native application here.For Your Languages and ToolsGraalVM is an open ecosystem and we invite third party systems to participatevia connecting their own programming languages, tools, or platforms.Implement Your Own LanguageThe Truffle Language Implementation framework allows running programming languages efficiently on GraalVM. It simplifies language implementation by automatically deriving high-performance code from interpreters. You can find details about the approach in this research paper.Implementing your own language using GraalVM will not only give you high performance. More importantly, it allows your language to connect with the rich tooling provided by the GraalVM ecosystem. Also, it enables your language to run in the context of any GraalVM embedding.            We developed a demonstration language called “SimpleLanguage” to show the use of GraalVM’s language implementation framework. Find out how to [get started]({{“/docs/graalvm-as-a-platform/implement-language/”      relative_url }}) implementing a language.      Create Language-agnostic ToolsGraalVM provides a framework for creating language-agnostic tools like debuggers, profilers, or other instrumentations. GraalVM provides a standardized way to express and run program code enabling cross-language research and the development of tools that are developed once and then can be applied to any language.",

Navigate to the GraalVM Releases repository on GitHub. Depending on the workload, select graalvm-ce-java8-windows-amd64-{{ site.product_version }}.zip or graalvm-ce-java11-windows-amd64-{{ site.product_version }}.zip and download. We will focus on GraalVM Community based on OpenJDK 8.  Unzip the archive to your file system.  Configure JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables. Setting environment variables via the command line will work the same way for Windows 7, 8 and 10.          Add the GraalVM bin folder to the PATH environment variable:        setx /M PATH &quot;C:Progra~1Javagraalvm-ce-java8-{{ site.product_version }}bin;%PATH%&quot;            Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to resolve to the GraalVM installation directory:        setx /M JAVA_HOME &quot;C:Progra~1Javagraalvm-ce-java8-{{ site.product_version }}&quot;        Note that the /M flag, equivalent to -m, requires elevated user privileges.              Restart Command Prompt to reload the environment variables. Then use thefollowing command to check whether the variables were set correctly:    echo %PATH%echo %JAVA_HOME%    Optionally you can specify GraalVM as the JRE or JDK installation in your Java IDE.  Install Additional ComponentsThe GraalVM distribution for Windows platforms includesthe JDK with the GraalVM compiler enabled, the functional GraalVM Updater utility to install additional components, GraalVM’s JavaScript engine and the developer tools(e.g., Chrome inspector based debugger, Profiler, etc.). Node.js support on the Windowsplatform is scheduled to be included in the next GraalVM release (20.1).GraalVM environment can be extended with additional components.To add support for Python, R, Ruby or WebAssembly languages interpreters in GraalVM Community Edition, use a functional gu utility.There is a component catalog on GitHub maintained by Oracle (gu available), from which you can install a component just by its name:gu install rubygu install rgu install pythongu install wasmTo install the LLVM toolchain component, run:gu install llvm-toolchainTo install GraalVM Native Image, run:gu install native-image            Additional components may be also installed from the local components collection. For more details, proceed to the [GraaVM Updater]({{“/docs/reference-manual/install-components/#component-installation”      relative_url}}) page.      Prerequisites for Using Native Image on WindowsTo make use of Native Image on Windows, follow the further recommendations. Therequired Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) version depends on the JDK version thatGraalVM is based on. For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 8, you will need MSVC2010 SP1 version. The recommended installation method is using Microsoft WindowsSDK 7.1:  Download the SDK file GRMSDKX_EN_DVD.iso for from Microsoft.  Mount the image by opening F:SetupSDKSetup.exe directly.For GraalVM distribution based on JDK 11, you will need MSVC 2017 15.5.5 or later version.The last prerequisite, common for both GraalVM distribution based on JDK 11 and JDK 8, is the proper Developer Command Prompt for your version of Visual Studio. Namely, it is should be the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. Use Visual Studio 2017 or later.",
